We have the text from 445 children's picture books (currently saved as word documents, easily converted to text files) that I need analyzed for gendered language. Some of the books were reported to be read only to girls, others only to boys, and some were reported to be read to children of both sexes. We're interested in whether the content is gendered (in potentially problematic ways, i.e., the standard differences in descriptors used for boy and girl characters) and whether there are differences in the content in the three sets. There are other possible content analyses that would be great to have done automatically too (as the human coders were pretty all over the place in terms of consistency, so we bailed on a lot of other coding). But even just the by now standard descriptors analysis would be super useful. Authorship possible.", "email": "Carla.HudsonKam@ubc.ca", "skills": "None specified", "members": "Unspecified"}]}
