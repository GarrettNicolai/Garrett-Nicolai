Another dream of mine is to pursue in the post graduate program after finish my degree. That is very difficult for me as I need a good GPA to get the financial loan. I think I didnt do well in my study at the moment. I dont think I am able to continue my study in master program.	1

To clarify, I don’t consider myself suicidal. I don’t WANT to die. I WANT a reason to be alive.I can't seem to be happy with my current life - only the future So I was diagnosed with mood swings/mild depression quite a while ago, and have been on a small dose of Fluoxetine (Prozac) most of my life now.	1
I remembered my promise to her. I was about to text her. And then i started to cry again. I will bother her. I will make her worried. I will waste her time. And i cant afford to hurt people i love.	1
I used to be so quick witted. I was always the funny friend, and I loved it.	1
Here’s our email address: youramigoam@gmail.com	1
I’ve struggled with depression for about 3 years now and I’ve had my highs and my lows. Recently I’ve been doing okay even though me and my girlfriend mutually broke up, but we’re still friends and she supports me. And my birthday is coming up soon so I was looking forward to that.	1
I know full well that anyone else wold have done a better job in life then me, I know I’m wasted potential and probably will never live up to the standers my brother set before me, don’t you think I know that ?! Don’t you think at eats at me almost every waking moment of my existence?!	1
I knew I was steadily falling in love with her (something I honestly thought impossible before) and just recently I found out she's got a boyfriend. I proceeded to spend the next 2 hours crying like a little bitch for the first time in over a decade. After that I couldn't even hit any fucking awp shots in cs cause I still had tears streaming from my eyes. My question is, have I reached the point of being pathetic enough that I should call it quits and neck myself?Having a heart stinks sometimes. :/ So Reddit I met this girl on a dating site, and it was going great. Texting was really fun, and we talked about a bunch of different stuff, then when we had a lunch date. Afterward she then didn't really respond to anything I sent her. This morning she tells me that there wasen't a connection. I'm a tiny bit upset, and I'm not to sure what to do. is there a comfort in sadness? my therapist, my psychiatrist, and my parents all say i’m “so much better” than i used to be. and i am. i know that. i don’t even think about suicide anymore and i haven’t self harmed in a few years.	1
I sent out this email to all 100 of my students about finals:	1
My mom has a bad habit of asking really odd, seemingly disrespectful questions to me and my brother about our relationships. A popular one she gives me is "I don't think you love him, he's more like you friend." She asked me this tonight over a phone call and I got upset with her and expressed how I feel uncomfortable and disrespected when she tells me things like that. Like she know's everything about my relationship, somehow, when I hardly tell her anything about it because her and my dad are quite old fashioned and very religious. She's told me things like this many times before, and usually I try to just try to brush it off, but I'm trying to get her to understand and communicate better with me and my brother.  She went on to say say "but i'm your mom, I can ask things like that." I understand she has a much different point of view, especially because she's older, but I just personally feel it's disrespectful to say that I don't love my boyfriend and that "he's just a friend." She kind of rolled her eyes at me, flatly said goodnight, and hung up.	0
Edit: Wow, I did not expect this response! It’s comforting to know I am not alone. We’re all in this together &amp; I feel happy to know I am a part of a sub with so many caring, kind people. If any of you need a friend or just need someone to talk to, I’m here.	1
Now that is out of the way,this might get quite long, so I will put a tldr at the end of this.	1
The past 5 Months has been depression only, and Honestly if people has gone through as much as me these past 5 months with suicidal thought every day, they would of gone mental.	1
I generally find television boring, have little to no interest in Netflix shows, anime, and most video games and hobbies. I really only have one hobby that I have feel attachment to,  and frankly, I dont enjoy most new shows. If I watch something of my own, its typically something I watched from when I was younger, like scooby doo or Phineas and ferb as the two main ones, being my absolute favorites from my youth, though that's rare as it is. And whenever I do those things, except for my one main hobby sometimes, I feel that I am all to aware that it's just escapism, and instead of escaping, I fall back into the same track. I don't  think I have a short attention span, but that's what I always feel like I go back to in the back of my head, as that's what people my age are supposed to have because of this digital age.I realised if I died, only my parents will care No I'm not suicidal. Having no friends, only my parents will care enough to be there. While the rest of my family members will be there just for show. Does anyone else imagine their depression as being much more 'dramatic' than it actually is? I always think of my depression as being something quite mysterious and I dramatise it in my own mind. It's as if my brain is just trying to make something of depression, which ultimately makes it worse because it gives part of my brain comfort in depression, as it least it gives me some kind of identity.	1
Unfortunately the last few days have been incredibly difficult, I'm getting a very sick feeling of hopelessness and worry that my life is now just constantly shuffling around desperately trying to find something in the world that will "fix" me. I tried to sit at home last night to give myself a break and I couldn't even do that, I started becoming consumed by those bad thoughts and began having a panic attack.. So I decided to just go drive aimlessly even though we were in the middle of a snow storm..	1
The other night, I got drunk and did something I’ve never done before, and that was cut myself. Honestly, I feel like I did it to see if I could, and how it would make me feel. I guess I still don’t know how it does, but I was disappointed in myself I let it get so far.	1
On July 1st my mother told me that she's been diagnosed with cancer. They took a biopsy of her lymph node yesterday to see if it has spread there. She is on a month of leave from work.	1
So just yesterday, my brother made a light-hearted joke to my dad and he got mad and slapped him. Later that evening, our mum asked him why he did that. So he drove off and came back at 1am. After this, our mum and dad haven’t spoken to each other. This morning my brother keeps arguing his point to our mum, I try to support her. My dad has done nothing. All he did was wake up, drove off and come back at 7:30pm to sleep, then he drove off again. So just a few hours ago, my mum tells my brother to clean up. This causes a arguement. I support mum, but my brother won’t stop yelling. I told him to stop 3 times but he told me, “You don’t have the authority to tel me to do anything”.  After this my mum asks me, “what should we do now?” Then I messaged my brother and things have been solved between us.	0
Lost a VOLUNTEER job because I am an idiot and kept screwing things up, and everybody wanted me gone.	1
I'm not sure if I'm depressed but I've never felt more alone or lost or confused in my life. I've managed to convince myself that I have no redeeming qualities and that my friends are only pretending to like me because they feel bad or somehow feel obligated to maintain a facade of friendship.	1

I am a 20 year old girl. My whole life, my sense of worth was dictated around whether I could make the people around me happy. I had extremely strict and controlling parents and so I had no real sense of worth other than the fact that at least I didn't harbour any malicious feelings towards anyone, or try and hurt anybody deliberately. I had normal teenage 'angst' and moody, brooding periods, but absolutely not depression at all. I was completely, for want of a better word, normal.	1
the only thing holding me back is guilt. but i won't feel it when i'm dead. reddit, this might be my goodbye. i'll let you know if i wake up.	1
But, even though you clean it and bandage it, it's of course still going to hurt. It's a cut. You just ignore the pain, though, because you've already taken care of it, and there's not much else you can do beyond that. You just have to live with the fact that it's going to hurt for a while.	1
I just don’t understand why are people act so shitty with me? Is it my face? Is it because no one cares and all I have is literally myself? Is it because I’m dying soon? What is it really? I just want to fucking die but I cant just let myself slash my throat or swallow a lot of pills because I’m a coward. I want the easy way out. Why isn’t cancer an instant death? Why aren’t suicide booths similar to futurama a thing?	1
I have no motivation to do anything at all anymore. I used to clock around 3-4 hours a day gaming because it was something I genuinely enjoyed. I've gotten 30 minutes in an entire damn week. I literally just can't muster the strength to want to do it. I've been pulling away from people because it's just exhausting to talk to them. I literally just get tired after five minutes of conversation. It's insane. We'll barely be through the how's your day been going before I already want to go somewhere else because it's so draining.	1
Stay safe, everyone.	1
My motto has always been "The truth is in the middle" but I've completely lost any direction and orientation. I've been costantly questioning myself and I don't even know what I want nor who I am anymore.	1
Idek if this makes sense but basically I’m just wondering if any of y’all go through or have gone through this as well?Thoughest time of my life, and honestly i cant show it So i meet this girl for nearly 2 years ago.	1
Since it's Christmas, I bought them each a couple of gifts and also Christmas stockings since they've both never celebrated Christmas in North America. I filled them with a bunch of candies, chocolates, soaps, etc.	1
So as soon as I met the new nurse and we went into the room to talk she told me she knows almost nothing about me despite there being many notes from the past year. I told her about leaving my job and feeling low and the self harm and everything and what she basically told me is ''you aren't depressed''. She said that my self harm was normal as it was just scratches and I wasn't cutting deep enough to leave any scars which just completely confused me considered i'd been put in hospital partly for doing the same thing before. I've also suffered with terrible social anxiety all my life and find it very hard to communicate with others. I told her the only friends i've ever had was the friends I've made years ago when I first started going to school and what she said was it sounds like I have great social skills as i've been able to make friends. It honestly felt like she wasn't listening to a single word I was saying. As I said she had no notes from before and was basically just assuming what was wrong with me and that was it. Also I should add i'm in the UK so this is with the NHS so i'm not paying for this however my parents have said they would be willing to pay for some sessions with a therapist if that's was I need.	1
She freaks out. She accuses me of lying to her when I didn’t lie. She then takes her car and starts to find where I was. She finds me and then we have an argument for two hours. She keeps on yelling at me saying that I should come back to the house and “forget about my anxiety”. I tell her I wanted to go back to the psychiatric ward in the hospital and she says that I’m being fucking ridiculous and should stop thinking like this.	1
I'm on my 4th medication and I feel like it's not working. Again. I have all these repressed memories coming up and I hate it. Why is my head so messed up? Why cant something just work for once?Cold turkey of Escitalopram So let me begin this by saying this is a terrible idea and I should definitely taper off with the help of my psychiatrist.	1
‘What did it take to find redemption?’ I often wondered, as grand sunlight was walking upstairs to knock the moon off it’s sleepy stool. I sat and watched a beautiful red giant approach, and drew images in mind to flicker about and echo in my concave dome of secrets. As the flickering opportunity ran full speed in front of me, I turned and felt the imagery toss into the incinerator. A great insecurity washed over the industry working ahead up above, slowing me down as I walked in slowly toward the place to call work.	1
Here's the summary: I wanna go back with my girlfriend, and I am depressed and sad if I'm not with her. I know we'll be hopefully soon together, but as the meantime, I feel like my days are worthless and my life is meaningless.	1
For example, my mom manages a nursing floor at a hospital. She told me one of her nurse's daughters died of a deadly disease at 20. And all I could think about was at 21 all I could think was how jealous I was of the deceased young woman, and how lucky she was. No ill will to her, I hope she rests in peace and that her family is coping.	1
My cousin lives there, about 25 minutes from where we are staying and I haven't seen her in years since she moved due to bad timing and life events. We were going to go meet her for dinner one evening (probably about an hour or so) during the trip.	0
My senior year I spent the fall studying abroad in France. It was magical. I fell in love for the first time. I wasn't reciprocated, but the thing I learned about love is that it doesn't have to be reciprocated to be the most beautiful thing you've ever felt.	1
I was at university for digital media and I finished. My first year but  when the second year started my IBS symptoms got worse and I was I physically unable to go. thankfully the university gave me a year off and said I can start my second year next year after I get better.	1

And the truth is I feel so angry, and the truth is I feel so fucking sad, and the truth is I've felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long I've been pretending I'm OK, just to get along, just for, I don't know why, maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own. Well, fuck everybody.Starting antipressants Hi, I'm a male in my early 30's and going to meet with an intake doctor tomorrow. I will probably wind up on antidepressants, so I have been looking up the side effects, and REALLY don't want to have erectile dysfunction and gain weight.	1
I let it slide since I thought maybe that was a mistake. Maybe she was so stressed out?	0
Now the issue I'm facing. I don't feel justified in being angry at him because he was trying to help and he just got too excited at seeing progress that I had made many times before and then he got frustrated when it came to a halt. So now I just feel guilty at having the feelings and the anger turns inward and eats me up. But the anger and hurt don't go away from what he said either. It's been months and I just don't want to talk to or see him at all. He's reaching out again and I can't find the words to  explain the anger and hurt I feel, because I feel like I shouldn't be angry or hurt. So it's just a big spiral of anger and shame.	1
Thanks for listening guysFriends Im in year 10 and i already feel like a failure. My friends never invite me out with them and recently ive felt like ive not even been wanted to hang out with them at break time and lunchtime. all they do is take the piss out of me and no one else. I have one good friend and who i trust but thats it. I just want someone i can talk to who understandsI've never felt more alone in my life and I don't know what to do about it. I recently graduated high school with a decent amount of friends but have only really kept in touch with about 3 of them. I'm going to a college two hours away so the likelihood that I'll be able to even see those 3 people is kind of dwindling once I move.	1
I don't want to give what I feel everyday the label of "depression", I feel like it just insults the people who knows they have depression. I have no idea where to get any help for whatever I feel. If I did, I would either be too lazy or too shy to ask.	1
i feel like i'm at my limit	1
This makes me pretty cranky while I'm making something to eat in the kitchen. If anyone tries to talk to me I just want nothing to do with them until I get some food in me. It's putting a real strain on some of my relationships.	1
It doesn't help that over the last two years, I kinda developed an eating disorder with anorexic, bulimic and binge-eating-tendencies that also made my health decline. I'm constantly thinking about numbers, looking up nutritional infos, reading medical studies, looking at food online - it's taking so much space in my head although I'm quite 'close to my goal', and I shouldn't even worry because if I keep doing what I planned (restrict for another 4-5 weeks, then slowly up my calories until I no longer lose weight, stay at maintenance and start to slowly incorporate exercise to finally be healthy, eating healthy, and exercising to maintain good health), there's no reason to be so occupied with this topic.	1
I'm tired of forcing myself to do things. Maybe it's me being lazy. Maybe it's my undiagnosed ADHD.	1

We all have the ability to give small act of kindness which goes a long way. From putting a smile on your face to giving away your coat to cover a pair of cold shoulders, dont underestimate the impact it has to them in the present and the future.	1
The therapist I saw about a year ago kinda threw me off as SAD and said it'd get better. I just dunno what to do.I’m a narcissist Downvote me, I deserve it. I should die alone isolated from civilization, starving and rotting to death in a hole. Don’t try to help me, I don’t deserve it. I hope I suffer even more before dying a gruesome and painful death because fuck me. Seriously I have no talents. Seriously I have no talent at all, im not good at nothing I swear.	1
These next two weeks will be a really, really tough time for all of you. I know how incredibly hard you all have worked this quarter, and how hard you will push yourselves during this final stretch, but there are 2 other things I want you to know:	1
Anyway, she went an entire week without speaking to me even though I sent her multiple texts. Maybe this was the moment, but I decided that I will not tolerate that type of power struggle. We're adults - you don't get to ignore someone because you don't like what they're saying and that's always been an issue with her: if she doesn't like what you have to say she comes up with delusional explanations as to why. Basically, she can never be wrong and if you think one negative thing about something related to her, she'll freak out, accuse you of being jealous even though she's the one not actually happy. The negativity is starting with her.	0
I can't talk myself out of it, but I feel I should give life a chance. I'm in such a shitty spot and I don't want to do this anymore, but if any of you have been talked out of a state like this before and feel like you can help me out, shoot me a message or comment.	1
I want to be unloved so I can die without any attachments I like to drive people away. I try to be rude to my family. I get too anxious to keep up positive relationships with others, I'd rather be alone so when the time comes when I want to kill myself, I won't be held down, and I won't have anyone tying me to this world.	1
I don’t know where else to go or who to talk to. I feel like I’ve annoyed everyone already enough about me that I no longer want to talk to literally anyone. My fiancé sometimes even.	1
But it was also kinda hard to say yes.	1
I miss the little girl so much. She was the best companion i could have had.Why me Ive been letting myself get played and led on by the same girl. I know its going to happen everytkme but everytime fall even harder for her. Right now everything hurts, i just don't want to feel anymore. Im tired of this pain called life. Death seems like my only way to not feel at allMy depression caused by other people. I feel as if a lot of people walk around like their better than me and I don't know why. I can sense them just looking down on me and judging me on my character and they don't even know me. I don't know if it's in my head or if some people are really like this.  Is it the way I dress? Is it the way I look? Do I not meet there expectations as a bystander? Like fuck, I was blessed and randomly put on this earth to be me, yet people can be so judgmental especially over things I can't control.	1
Have stopped taking escitalopram for about a week now and am not exhibiting any withdrawals or issues regarding the cold turkey. My question is: am I an anomaly or am I due for a bitter time in the near future?	1
It finds a way to connect to memories. To healthy feelings. And twist them into something dark. It craves uncertainty and pain and tells you that you deserve only that. It makes you seek out the deepest crevices of your mind and get lost. To the point where you don’t even know what’s you and what’s the sickness anymore. It almost feels good to indulge because it’s so familiar. We’re taught that enduring pain is somehow one of the most beautiful things a person can do. But what if that pain isn’t real?	1

The medicine isn't working. The AA old timers are saying I'm depressed because I'm not working the steps correctly. I'm going to 2-3 meetings a day, most days.	1
I feel like I’m barely supporting myself, and honestly I haven’t talked to my brothers since the youngest ones birthday (April 15th). Because I feel like I failed them. I haven’t talked to my grandma either because I feel like a disappointment.	1
I spend my days walking my dog, reading wikipedia articles, youtube, etc. I haven't spoken to another person since Monday. I just stay in my room and my parents don't come in. I don't have any hobbies, not even video games so I don't even have "online" friends.	1
It is kinda sad that I depend so much on other people, but I think my best friend cured my depression. Honestly got in an enlightening convo with him, I feel really really really great!I think I'm in an abusive friendship and I don't know what to do. One of my close friends with borderline has been constantly reinforcing and triggering my social anxiety. Everything is apparently all my fault, always, Apparently everyone (whatever that means) says I'm nuts, Im controlling, blah blah. She tried to rediagonse my depression as a narcissistic personality disorder. There's a laundry list of things that have been said to me. It's making me feel useless and sad and reinforcing the notion that no matter how hard I try I will never be good enough, that maybe I deserve to be alone, etc.	1
My childhood was so beautiful. It was in France. It's been now a whole decade since I left France - the country I've always admired and will always do. I remember going to school, having so many friends, I felt like I'm the happiest child on Earth.	1

It’s been 4 years since I’ve fallen for a girl back in college, which ended up in heartbreak and depression because she already found someone else. I’ve lost all motivations and my passion for arts (I’m an art student), failed my thesis which sent me into another dark place, ’friends’ were not even there to help me get up, and for the remaining years I had in college, the thing that kept me going are my parents, I just wanted to survive for them. I’ve lost all emotions, the flame that was once burning in my heart, the excitement I had when I was a freshman. I graduated college 7 months ago and found work not related to the course I took up, it felt really low, but I just wanted to survive. Training for work now, didn’t want to make friends again, had one, but he didn’t liked the people so he left in a few weeks, the only thing in my mind was to focus and be better for this job to survive. Avoided lunch and hanging out with workmates, and didn’t really reveal much about myself aside from having a mundane life. The trainers were aware of my introversion and decided to have random sitting arrangements every week so we could get to know our workmates more, and I could get to talk about other stuff aside from work. 3 weeks in training and still, I didn’t made any connections, I only help out my workmates professionally, point out mistakes and the next step they should take.	1
When I say I’m sick, they are too quick to assume the depression is the cause of my pain and not the other way around. After five minutes listening to me breathe, looking into my throat, and and touching the outside of my neck, they are stumped so it must be mental illness. It got the the point that when I was having severe abdominal pain, I didn’t go to the hospital. I had to push for any kind of testing, which took forever. When I finally found a doctor who listened to me, she told me I should have gone to the ER. Then I was depressed about that; I had let the other doctors make me doubt my own sanity.	1
Stranger: im sorry	1
I might as well have a heart attack and just die. I hate this. I'm lonely, i'm always sad and i'm just a piece of shit that is worthless.	1
Now I just slate the days away, it's hard, but there's no other option for me right now.. Why is life horrible to me and only me It just seems like one bad thing after another.  Every time I try to reach out and open up to people it just goes down in flames. They always be like , no your not depressed , its your fault that your this way and only you can helped yourself. Always shunning me away and ignoring me. Then its always my fault. You didn't help with the decorations its your fault it failed.extreme sadness whenever seeing anything happy Hello, this has been bothering me for a while and i have no idea what is this but when i ever i read or see anything happy like a happy scene or a happy story from some random comment i feel a huge wave of sadness wash over me and i feel like crying, why? what is going on? (i am not sure if this belongs to here but if not i don't mind it being deleted and sorry for breaking rules.) It’s not some fucking sadness anymore. This is madness. I remember when I just had a few days when I felt sad and out of it. And I would worry but then everything became better a few days later. Still, I went to a psychologist, because my downs were too consistent to be considered normal.	1
But ever since her death, I think I've been more depressed and lonely without her. I've been so much more angry and isolated, I think. I want a furry companion so, so much, but I don't think it will happen anytime soon, no matter how urgent or how much I rather need one, and that makes me even more depressed. There's been so much going on, so it's not a good time to look for a kitten; however, the thing is, I don't know how much longer I have to wait, and I don't know how much longer I \*can\* wait, because my family moved, and the house we live in is being renovated, so I don't even have a room yet. My wild guess is that it could take maybe a year for everything to settle, but I cannot wait that long at all before getting a cat.	1
I feel so alone without him, and I really need some comforting words, and maybe some advice on what to do. A little less sad tonight I really don't know what to say anymore. I can't say anything about stuff I love to people without feeling like I am a burden to them.	1
I turn my phone off. I get rid of all kind of distraction. But I can't. I've given up. I've been days trying to study, but my brain can't keep the info.	1
Thank you all for sharing your stories and responding. The meme is quite funny, I’m going to try to send it to everyone who asked. Cheers Constant battle between ambition and not wanting to live. Since I was about 12 I've had recurring suicidal thoughts. The thing is, I don't have low self esteem or anything of that sort, it's actually quite the opposite and I always joke about being a narcissist. I may not be an actual narcissist, but I've always had a slight superiority complex.  I don't hate myself, but I just hate my life and the continuous chore known as living. On the outside, I've always been the life of the party, but deep down I don't ever remember being happy. As someone who's highly ambitious, it feels as if there's a never ending struggle between wanting to be successful enough to be well known or have an impact on the world, and wanting to stop existing. Yet with the prospect of the latter, comes the failure of the former. I know that if I lowered my expectations in life I would be mildly happier, yet the thought of settling for mediocrity gives me horrible anxiety and fills me with dread.	1
What sucks though is trying to get over that primal instinct to not kill myself. I don’t particularly want to live and I really don’t want to live past ~40, but my dumb animal brain just thinks “owie death and pain bad” and won’t let me do it. I’m kinda hoping that maybe instead I can get into an accident or just get really ill.bored of consumerism Already bought everything I've ever wanted and more. I have designer clothes. I have a rolex. I have $200 shoes. I have a porsche 911. I've bought $1000 escorts. I don't even get a rush from these things anymore. It's boring. I just want to be good looking and have a gf who loves my looks. THat is all. Sick of being single but girls don't like depressed guys with anxiety. It sucks.Dazed Zombie Girl Whenever I wake up in the morning. I get a panic attack. Feeling dread and anxiety. Stressing over the future. It's terrible. Mornings are always the worst. Alienating family Do you ever get tired of saying you're okay when you're not but you don't want to talk about it? So instead you just stop talking to them but then you feel worse for alienating your family and they have no idea why or what's going on with you.	1
I want this all to end. I don't know how to survive. I don't know how people manage it. I don't have that self-preservation sense that keeps people going despite it all. I'm weak. I am weak in ways that I can barely accept.	1
Empty conversations with people I could not care less about	1
I have been with him for years, through thick and thin. I have had to bring him to the hospital before, and he did get better for a few months. He told me tonight he doesn't want me to pick him up from work, and that he wasn't going to come home. At this point I feel completely lost, and I know calling the police won't help.	1
I know its not healthy, but aren't we supposed to do these things by fearing what will happen to ourselves? I think I have lost the fear of consequences of my actions.	1
Anyway, this is where things took a turn. While I was trying to explain that, she stopped me and said: "I'm sorry, I can't do this. I offered to help cause I thought you were just having girl problems, or school problems, or something. I didn't realize you were totally emo. We're not in high school anymore. Besides, you're a guy, just toughen up". That last part stung. I knew that was a common sentiment in our society, but to hear it coming from her, someone I've been friends with since high school, really took me by surprise. I didn't know what to say, so I didn't say anything. I just kind of looked down at my lap. We sat quietly for a moment, until she got up and started gathering her things. As she started to walk away I said: "I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable, I wasn't trying to do that." She looked back at me and said: "Look, a big reason I'm friends with you is because of your positive attitude. It's infectious, and I love that about you. But if that's really just a mask, then you should probably just keep the mask on if we're going to continue being friends.", and then she left.	1
I seem to use daydreaming and fantasizing as an escape. I spend an embarrassing amount of mental time each day imagining myself as a frontman for a successful band; I really look up to someone like Father John Misty, I feel we have similar sensibilities on a lot of things. And there is just something about pouring your emotions and thoughts into an album, performing it live and connecting with people through that authenticity, that really makes me regret not taking learning music seriously up until this point in my life. I could really use that sort of emotional release right now. Same with writing, when school isn’t consuming every moment of my waking day I like to read a lot, so I’d like to write a book one day on something I care about.	1
I understand that she is getting abit tired of me now,	1
I don't think friends know more than i told them, but i know there is something they hide from me.	1
Stranger: where do u live	1
The reason I am writing this is because I promised myself to one day help the 15-year-old me whose cries for help where tossed to the side, who was told she was over-dramatic and crazy, and who thought that cutting was the only way to cope. There was a reason I grew up surrounded by mental illness. I watched not only myself go through it, but I saw my brother, my parents, my friends, and so many people on the news struggling with their own demons. And this didn’t happen because life felt like fucking me over, it was just trying to show me what my reason for living is.	1
Person: "I had three compound fractures and internal bleeding. They said it was the worst they've ever seen. But they fixed it, and the rehab I've been doing has brought it back to 100% functionality".	1
The next couple of weeks are bad not only is our group divided, I am the odd man out they spend the bulk of their time with NG and ignore me for the most part. So I confront my two friends (one I’ve been friends with for five years and the other three), I tell them it’s unfair that I am getting the short end of this situation when she made the decision to break up the group, I also tell them that the fact that they were willing to lie and go behind my back is wrong and that they justify it by claiming that NG is the victim because she lost a friend (so did I). They have apologized for the lying and going behind my back but I told them that I don’t feel comfortable with them spending time with her and being friends with all the problems she caused me and their easy willingness to lie for her to me. They tell that they will always be friends with her and that I can’t ask them to cut her off because it would divide the group, even though she already divided the group by pushing me out and they did nothing about it as a matter of fact the backed her up and supported her decision. So I told them that I have too walk away from the group then because I don’t feel valued, respected, or able to trust them after what they have done.	0
I think it's noteworthy that some of the biggest words in the cloud are negative.	1
We have literally been talking for nearly  2 years straight.	1
One of my two best friends died in a car crash because he was getting me a stupid birthday gift, my other best friend killed her self because I let my guard down and wasn’t there when she needed it, and my aunt drug overdosed two weeks ago, she wouldn’t have been on them if I hadn’t put that unnecessary stress on her	1
Throughout the years I’ve grown a part from people and I’ve distanced myself from people I felt were toxic. I’ve had my heart broken by a few friends. But right now I’m sitting here looking at this funny meme I wanted to share and I realized I have no one to send it to. I hope all of this makes sense one day. Goodnight	1
There's also the problem with others' expectations of me;; Almost all my life, I've been deemed "smart", which has caused so much pressure and anxiety throughout the years. My parents really want me to do well in school, and peers think I'm so great at everything. I *thought* it would go away after elementary school, but even here, people consider me being so "smart" and able to do anything. With currently a ~95 average in my classes, it's extremely difficult to maintain that and I feel like if I do any worse, someone is going to get mad at me. People expect me and think I'm so good, but really I'm just average at literally everything I do. I also have no idea what I want to do with my life. I'm not very good at anything, and I have so many interests, it's hard to pin down something that I *should* do with my time. Nothing really interests me enough to do it for like 25~40 years of my life, and the things I would be interested in have literally no way of making a living off of or is something totally unachievable. I feel like I can't make any difference to anyone in the world, and I'll die not making an impression on anyone or having anyone really care about me in the end.	1
You: haha	1
Anyway. Health insurance. I can't figure out how to fill out the income stuff. A hospital near me has people that can help but I just can't find the motivation to even call them. It's like I'm trying to prevent myself from getting help. It's not even just psychiatric reasons that I want health insurance. I have a referral for a neurologist. I've been having memory issues, twitches, etc. I know I won't go without insurance. I probably could stand to get on birth control and check out some other persistent problems too but a) I know I won't be taken seriously and b) the only thing I genuinely like about myself is my mind so that's the priority.	1
I joined the Army at 18. I had gotten recklessly married a month prior to shipping to basic. I ended up fucking up and missing a bus which led to a Lemony Snicket series of Unfortunate Events type shit. I went through partial infantry brainwashing but never made it past the build-up.	1
Oh tissue tissue how many tears can you soak? Depression is no joke, not cured by drink or smoke, more scarier than a stroke, leaves a scar on most folk. That's the power of one dead bloke.	1
So yeah, my dad showing no signs of it, had a massive heart attack on the 14th and passed away on the 16th at 73 years old. I realize people's times do come, and he had health problems(As far as we knew, no heart disease, had been checked out) but he didn't smoke or drink and he lost a lot of weight and took care of himself for the most part. He was slowing down, but no more then an older person would.	1
Help please! Is this friendship normal, and have I done the right thing? Hi everyone,	0
now I'm going to have to look over my fucking shoulder every five seconds when I'm in the hallways and just fuck me straight to hell if we end up having any classes together I can't fucking stand myself so I know she can't aaahhh	1
Went to therapy for four years made me feel like garbage. Tried five different therapists one on one and three different groups.	1

My next logical step is to move back to my mother's. Which is not only depressing. She's just 40 minutes from everything.	1
She was my best friend and my girlfriend for 2 years. I never felt a connection with anyone else as strong as I did for her. Now I’m fearing my depression may have come back. I’m thinking I didn’t defeat depression but instead had her to use as a support. I’m here on the east coast of the US and I have no friends or family around me. I don’t know what to do and everyday I just feel like it’s me vs the whole world. I’ve already lost all hope and I feel like I don’t deserve happiness. Why else would happiness be ripped from me every time I feel like I found it.	1
I also feel insufferably tired lately, hence the sleep issues post on /r/getting_over_it.When you get in the shower and turn the water to maximum heat and just sit down and cry. Let the water hit you and keep the curtain open to let the cold wind breeze through your pores. I put a loaded rifle in my mouth So about a month ago I got really drunk and kind of lost my shit I usually just suck it the fuck up but I don't know if it was the alcohol or if I was just fucking done with it but I came into my bedroom and put a loaded rifle in my mouth and was going to pull the trigger but my sister walked in and grabbed the gun away from me she told the rest of the family and they to me to the ER and then put me in the nut House for a few days they let me out after I said I was fine and don't know what happened I lied and told them I blacked out and don't remember anything about that night but I do so they let me out but I'm still fucked up and now I find myself sitting there alone with my pistol on my lap just thinking and I don't really feel nervous about it anymore I just feel like it may be the way to go just get in my truck and drive off somewhere where no one will find me and do it I hate it when bad people get rewarded One of the facts that depresses me most about life is when bad people get rewarded and live comfortably, and loved by all.	1
Jesus. For now, I'm playing the game they wanna play. They wanna be fake with me, I'll be fake with them. I act all fine and dandy around my mother and everyone else. I smile, I joke. All a facade. So when the right time comes, when I can finally burn bridges with them, **it will fucking hurt mom.** Mom, yes. Because everyone else would be glad I'm gone. But, my mother, will hopefully finally realize her fucking mistake and die a fucking failure of a mother. Coping With Depression with False Laughter Does anyone here try to combat their depression with laughter and jokes when dealing with people?	1
Stranger: dont feel lonesome	1
My heart breaks for all the precious souls trapped in bodies struck by that horrible desease, while my own body stubbornly keeps existing and breathing and providing home for this rotten mind and filthy soul and I feel I've ripped off everyone that could use this body and it's so disgustingly unfair	1
It felt good to do this but also sad at the same time knowing I will wake up to nothing on Christmas morning. I've lost 4 Marines to depression and almsost lost a 5th. None saw combat. I need help understanding. Hi.	1
I almost cried in front of people I know It was all relatives, they were all chatting and playing, and I sat alone because I felt unwanted and not belonging. Then a wave of darkness hit me, and my eyes got wet and red, right there in the open, and some of them noticed... And that's it, no one tried to talk to my or anything after it.Told my mother I tried to kill myself, she admitted she also tried when i was a baby. I've been struggling with this  sickness for a while, it cost me my job, and a few friends, but only now i can publicly say that i tried to kill myself on the 19th of February. I tried to hang myself with a belt, fortunatelly i bought a really shitty one at primark and the only thing it did was leave me on the floor gasping desperatelly for air, filled with a sense of failure and a huge shame. I've always been an outgoing, funny, talkative and very active guy and i just felt as is i runned out of batery like something was leaving me without lifeforce.	1
I was completely overwhelmed, and became less and less effective at my job. I put A in the exact position that I had been in the previous year. I could feel him resent me more and more every day, but I was too ashamed to talk to him about it, and he never asked me how I was doing.	1
I am 22 and had quite severe depression during the age of 17-18. My past 3 years of life from the ages 19-22 have actually been great and I have had no problems. I have had a girlfriend since the age of 20 whom I love. I have worked a few different mundane jobs, and have been going to school for electrical engineering. I am entering my last year of undergraduate school in the ASU online program.	1
- I was offered a management position, but after being hired, was told "I know nothing, and might manage eventually, but right now was incapable of doing so."	1
My parents are also hounding me to get a girlfriend. I dont even have a friend who is a girl. All my close friends are male. Hell, the closest Ive came to having a full conversation with a girl is helping her with spanish homework. I aint gay, I just cant talk to girls. The social anxiety makes me want to vomit if I even think about approaching a girl.	1
It hurt, but i guess people eventually get used to being ignored.	1
Also I think I’m losing my mind I catch myself doing weird things and sit there like wtf did i just do that for	1
A letdown. I skip so many songs i used to love. All they do now is remind me of my friends who have passed away. Family who are gone. My life evolving into something i hate. Music used to be an escape, now it leads my mind and emotions into a trap. I started hurting myself tonight... I've never done it before, but I just can't deal with the mental pain anymore.  I'm trying to distract myself with physical pain.  It's weird how it makes you think about that rather than how shitty things are...I guess it's temporary relief, but it helps.please share with me what you do to feel less depressed hello, i wanted to talk to somebody else that the people i know in real life, i have really good friends, and most of my family supports me but i dont have the courage to talk to them about how i feel, i know they have their own problems they have to deal with and i dont want to put any more pressure than they already have, ive been struggling with this since i was about 10 or 11, i had alot of stress in my life since i work since i was little, i have never had a relationship with someone and im pretty touch starved, but i just want somebody to talk to, because everyday is getting worse, every day i wake up and dont know why should i keep living, keep trying to get my shit together, why do i matter as a person why even keep giving hopes to the people around me, because i am always there when they need me, but i am too ashamed to ask them for help because in my head if i do so i feel like they would see me diferently and not respect me anymore, i just want somebody that i cant talk to at peace, just talk, pleaseJust the idea of life makes me depressed. Why do I even try? I really dont know. I have a job I hate, with a shit boss that blames me for every little thing, only to make money so I can buy the things I like so I keep on ''living''. I know im not gonna get anything better, I suck at everything I like to do so I cant have really get a job about my passion. Never had a relationship and probably never will. Ive never even met anyone who had a ''crush'' on me or anything and I dont look bad. Something pretty bad got blamed on me again at work and my boss is coming back from her vacation tomorow. I really dont want to get scolded and start crying in front of customers. Im the nicest person there and I only made 2 or 3 mistakes since ive been there but for some reason she still seems to hate me. I just have nothing that makes me want to keep living except maybe my love for video games. If I get yelled at again, I dont know what ill do. I just hate living in general, if you can even call it ''living'', more like slaving your life away to me! Anyway I'm just venting here, if you want to share your feelings you are welcome, I'll read them when I can. :)I’m the “funny guy”. When I’m near people I love (anybody that shows a moderate amount of affection towards me) I always try to bring them up. Life sucks for all of us. I just want to make people happy.	1
I’ve been to the Doctors and have done a MRI, they say its nothing. Just functional.  (Whatever that means...)	1
- So what have you been doing this whole time?	1
I can't blame people for not loving me, but I do blame them for lying to me. Don't they know it hurts more to say 'I care' when they don't, and it takes me much too long to figure it out? How am I ever supposed to trust people when they say they care if it's been such a common lie? The worst part is, *nobody can prove it, because nobody can help me, because nobody knows how or wants to*, I don't know. I've been asking for help for a long time now but nobody takes me seriously.	1
i smoke weed, i felt exactly like you feel when you’re high, except i didn’t feel slow. is this how antidepressants are supposed to make you feel if theyre working? i kind of want some now if it means i love life Why am I so bad at everything I’m even bad at my own hobbies. I’ve been producing music since like sophomore year of high school and 4 years later I’m still trash. I’ve went to the gym and tried to be consistent but I’m too stupid to work out alone and even though I watch videos on  form I feel like my form is always shitty. I’m shitty at talking to people and making friends. Im losing all my friends because my depression makes me distance myself away from people in hopes of them noticing my absence but no one notices. I’m shitty at school. I’m shitty at driving. I’m shitty at talking to girls. I just prefer to lay down in bed and listen to good music that I’ll never be able to make due to my lack of standing out as a producer.I am overwhelmed by guilt over my boyfriend's sexual assault of my once-best friend. My boyfriend of 2 years and I both suffer from mental health issues and trauma. I found out somewhat recently that months ago, when my then-best friend was sleeping over we were both asleep in the bed and he touched her sexually. Apparently he was stoned and thought he might start a threesome (it was casually mentioned as a possibility earlier).	1
You’re not worth a thorned crown.	1
I'm ubering to my job at the moment. I just basically shut down at the start of sundown. Shut down and drank for 4 or 5 days with the last one with me on the phone with a rope on my neck.	1

You cannot be loved appropriately if you cannot love yourself first.	1
Before then we were close travelling together and going to events and parties all the time. My kids don't get it. Where is auntie they say , can we go visit? I just say she's busy.	0
I really, really don’t want to wake up. A poem to vent So lately I've been unable to write at all. So I decided that if I can't get the inspiration, I'm writing about why I can't get this inspiration, and instead of writing another dadaistic poem I tried to do something you guys might like, so I want to share it.	1
For a few years after that I stopped caring about my appearance. I got so fat and I just kept eating and eating. I stopped caring about my grades and didn’t even try. I would just turn in a blank paper with my name on it.	1
You, who says that I shouldn't give up. Why? I'm not you. Years from now I will *not* be surrounded by people who love me, I will *not* be anywhere closer to happiness, I will *not* find anyone who loves me. If that person exists, and perhaps they do, I will *not* ever have the luck to meet them.	1
Feeling lonely sucks. I wished I feel loved by those whom I love. But staying away (while not killing myself)  is my only way to protect them from myself.	1
I liked seeing three girls meet each other outside and say "Hiiii how are youuuu?" and compliment each other. Instead of normally being irritated by that, I actually admired that people in reality share bonds and happiness with each other's presence, and it made me happy to see that.	1
When my mate is talking to me or anyone else. All we get is a bombardment  "what if she doesn't like me" and other relationship jargon. I don't care but I have to pretend to. He cannot talk about anything else ever. It's just relationship this relationship that. I'm sick of it.	0
Orlando seems to have this... massive victim complex. This isn't entirely unjustified mind you^ , but the problem is, he tends to extend this to friends. If say, Grath or Fallow decide to do something together, Orlando assumes he is being excluded on purpose and maliciously.	0
Or see what waits beyond my youth?	1
I wanna be a better person but I don't know how. My anxiety feels like a prison. It's really hard for me to leave the house. I HATE being around people, but I don't want to be alone either. Going to the store is a nightmare for me, the panic attacks and worrying I'm in someones way all the time. I only go in the middle of the night and never by myself.	1
EDIT: Please don't say happy birthday, it makes it worse. Thanks. Feelings of isolation, even among friends How do you deal with the feeling that you don't belong anywhere? That no one ever understands you? I always feel this way around everyone and every group I'm in. Family gatherings, movies, friend parties, etc.	1
Other thatn that ive been bullied for 15 years, i've lived alone for since i was 16.	1
Despite often being a bad actor, I am just so well at playing this role of „Of course, I will try! I will do my best“.	1
Am I really that defective that I am just not good enough ?!	1
I often ponder the idea of giving up completely. Has anyone given up completely? How does it feel like?	1
It might seem small or sorta stupid, but it made me feel like someone cared about me. That I wasn't the idiotic nobody my depression tells me I am all of the time. I felt motivated and happy for the first time in weeks. I cleaned my room and did work that I'd been ignoring for months. I finally felt like maybe, just maybe, I meant something.	1
I don’t see a future where I’m able to continue school. Dfchs told me they couldn’t help pay for college because “I wasn’t in for long enough before beginning college” but they had no fucking problem coming to my dorm and asking me questions and causing stress once a week.	1
A few times I've forced myself to draw I was garbage, but I figured that's to be expected since I haven't done it in a while. However lately I've found playing video games much more difficult because I find myself pressing the wrong button almost purposely, or not reacting to something my brain processed seconds ago. It's even gotten to the point where typing is difficult for me--every other letter I find myself making a stupid typo, and its irritating. It shouldn't take every ounce of will and concentration to type a stupid reddit post, yet here we are........“I wonder how the world would be if they didn’t have me” I heard this lyric and it sticks with me....fuckDoes anyone else have this constant dark feeling lingering over them? Recently my mom died and this dark feeling of hopelessness has been worse than ever before. I don't know what to do anymore. Nothing makes me happy, and I don't want to die but I don't want to exist either. I can occasionally enjoy things, but at the end of the day I just think to myself, "why am I still doing this?" Everyone keeps telling me that I have to live for myself and not search for answers through others but I feel like I can't help myself. I feel like no one around me understands what I'm going through. I feel like a robot at work, forcing myself to seem okay. I just feel like living with this feeling inside of me is so hard, and maybe genuinely not even worth it. I don't even feel like taking my medicine or eating heathy or anything. I just wake up, go to work, come home and sleep as much as possible. Sorry to rant on here, I'm not sure what else to do. Can't remember the last time I had a good day First time poster here.	1
Stranger: hopping?	1
The best way I can summarize it is that this world has so much "noise", and it's exhausting for me. I get exhausted just from thinking about it. I wish people could just relax, and stop stirring so much motion around. It's always been like this for my entire life. I'm so tired. Everything/everyone has to move around with such haste, but all I want to do is stop. I just want to appreciate the colors. I want to laugh. I want to be happy.	1
Does this make sense from a psychological stand point to be greiving for this long? I know there is no time limit on emotions but does it make sense for my depression to be as a result of shoving down his death and holding onto it for all this time? I would love to hear some thoughts and opinions.	1
You: i do almost all the things your "supposed" to do to cure depression and loneliness. but i can't get it out of my mind and i am not sure what to do anymore	1
This continued until march or 2018, when I noticed her slipping back in to her just overall never satisfied state. I got worried and tried to lightly push her to no avail. I then tried to make plans at least twice a month to help distract her and give her a solid thing to look forward to. She never changed and just got worse to the point where the last 2 months, she gets home from work smokes enough weed to put me to sleep, eats too much and then goes to sleep by 9. I tried to encourage by proxy by going to the gym and going to parks with her dog and taking pictures and even getting closer with her family. nothing worked.	1
No one has every seemed to seek me out or wanted to be around me. I'm the only person that enjoys my company and that's all I have. I talk to myself a lot. I make myself laugh a lot. This is occurring to me as I'm typing it and I feel like crying. I just want a person I can make laugh and inspire. I want to make a difference in someone else's life.I just feel trapped I'm finishing up my Masters degree and just feel hopeless right now. I hate school. I'm starting to hate my field of study too. I play the trumpet. But to be honest, I'm not very good at it. High notes, any other trumpet player will be able to understand. In the past two years, my playing has underwent some other terrible thing where I hesitate at the start of anything I play. It's 100 percent mental. I've made some strides in it, but it still comes back. For the past two years, it has made me feel like I can't even play a simple fucking melody to someone if asked. Trumpet is basically my adventure, but it seems like I just cause myself pain. I want to keep working on it, but boy it hurts my soul to suck and to keep not doing well. On top of that, I struggle with my weight. I love fast food. I know it's bad, but I use it to cope. I also would love to stop watching porn. I'm addicted to that. I've been addicted to that since I was probably in the 4th grade. I just feel trapped, like I don't have the self control or am not smart enough to discipline myself to fix these problems. I'm just sick of being a loser in life. Is there any hope?Does anyone care? I have 1 friend but I haven’t physically seen them in 7 years but we FaceTime and talk every single day until recently. No big deal I’m pretty used and expect people to drift out of my life. I know people who I used to be friends with but now we are just accquantences, we don’t talk at all but follow each other on social media. But here’s the thing, when you post things on social media about how you are ready to kill your self or how depressed you are and you don’t even get a text asking if you’re okay- does that mean no one cares? I see them caring about other people but they never seen to make sure if I’m okay. I mean I don’t expect them to, but I know when I see people that I care about talking like that I need to make sure that they’re okay. I mean, how can you say you’re friends with someone but not even say anything when they’re threatening to kill the selves. It’s weird, you’ll be Sauk g how much you want to die and how depressed you are and no one will say anything BUT they’ll make sure to send you a picture on Snapchat to keep the streak lol. Worthy enough for a number on Snapchat but not worthy enough to live in their eyes	1
Today, I've asked one of my female coworkers about what degree is she going for even though I keep asking that question when I forgot. She told me she's going for a dental bachelor. I've brought up that I've brought this up a bunch of times and she nodded.  I felt pretty embarrassed for asking that question and forgetting the answer a lot of times. (She isn't the only one though)	0
I'd say we are probably more then best friends, we are soul friends.	1
To add to that, my friend's mother died of a heart attack on my 18th birthday, and I spent my 20th alone due to the fact that all of my old high school friends had moved on and my best friend had decided to join the military. Well, today was my 21st. My best and only friend completely forgot about me. My dad then made me have an emotional meltdown. Now it is nearly midnight and my only company is the nearly empty bottle of wine sitting next to me, so I am not only sad, but also slightly drunk. Happy birthday to me.Wish I could simultaneously apologize to, and forgive, everyone I've hurt and that have hurt me Unfortunately most of those people have cut ties. Guess I'll need to work on apologizing and forgiving myself instead.	1
If this is also posted in the wrong place, please let me know and I'll gladly move it to the right subreddit.I wanted to die 30 minutes ago I finished writing my suicide note, was about to down a bottle of pills. Then my mom texted me. I don't know if it was fate or a coincidence but I decided not to. I can't bear the thought of her seeing me dead.I can't cry... I want to but can't... I'm *intensely* upset with a situation and feel *incredibly* distressed but can't cry... I don't understand? I used to be able to cry and let out emotion or even cry naturally but I just can't anymore, I don't have the capacity. My gf is planning on killing herself and idk what to do... Ok so me and her have known each other for 9 months. We are in a long-distance relationship. We have never met in real life. I think she may be bipolar. One night she told me she cut herself a little bit. On her thigh. At first I thought she was joking. She showed me the mark if lefted in the morning and I knew it was serious. She is 16 and I am 18. She has told me before she wants to die. She has had a bad past with men but I won't go into any details. It was just really bad. She doesn't talk to her parents about it just me. Her mother and father may get a divorce so that makes this situation even worse. She can be really happy at times then really down. We get in fights sometimes but they are usually resolved. She always complains she is a bad gf because she treats me like shit. I forgive her for doing so because of her shit life. Today we were just talking casually and a few mins later she said I will kms on said date. Then I told her why would u. She said love u bye. We then went back and forth until I decided to leave her alone. She said she wasn't feeling ok. But I have never heard her give me a date before. Saying you will is one thing but a date means you have planned out how u want to go. I didn't tell my parents the full story and neither has she. She has tried killing herself before. I didn't know her at the time. She doesn't have any friends in real life and the ones she does have just use her. She is also behind in school which stresses her out. I will go into more details if anyone is willing to help me and thank u for hearing me out.I lost my father to a sudden and completely unexpected heart attack two weeks ago. I've been up and down, but right now I'm at a loss. What are some strategies you'd employ(secular wise, i'm non religious). I suffer from severe anxiety(GAD) and severe depression. xpost /r/griefsupport I'm going to seek counselling by the way very soon. My Dad's service hasn't happened yet. I was planning after that to start up again but with this added part.	1
Apparently I had a few months to live if I hadn't caught it. Ironically, now, I wish they hadn't discovered it. My world flipped upside down. No Powerlifting, no excessive exercise, restricted fluid intake, no over exertion, meds for the rest of my life, regular reviews in my heart clinic, multiple ambulance emergency rides to A&amp;E when my heart goes irregular. Hospital, pharmacy, hospital, pharmacy... Seems to be my life for the past year.	1
Depression is the exact opposite. It's calmness, not giving a shit about anything, basically relaxing. I feel kinda comfortable being depressed. I lie on the bed and look at the ceiling, at the wall, whatever. Like I'm on autopilot.	1
Both my family and my girlfriend were very important to me, and I guess helping them out made me feel good about myself, even though the situation was shitty. I kind of let school fall to the back-burner though. And I kind of neglected my other friends for a while as well. But between work, my family, and her, I was consistently busy.	1
Happy 20 Any recommended supplements/vitamins for depression? (Or maybe just tips in general) Lately, I have been taking Vitamin D and doing some light exercising throughout the week and I have noticed the improvement on my mood.	1
So I've read about how SSRIs can send bipolar people who are misdiagnosed with unipolar depression / anxiety into hypomania or mania. I've also read that SSRIs can have activating effects during the start up period (including insomnia, restlessness, distractibility) that sound similar to some of the symptoms of hypomania.	1
I'm at the end of high school and soon have to decide on what school i want next but i don't want to work in the future, as i would just always feel like shit, be under pressure or whatever	1
I can't wait to sleep But I'm afraid of dreams The thought of morrow makes my mind go scream	1
Before it all happened, I sometimes looked at you and thought that this would happen to you. It is the way you used to hold your emotion. It is as if you were full to the brim with it, but you forced it down, shoved it into a box  and hid it away. It was strange, but I was too young to understand. And then, slowly but surely, it took you over. You were so young. In my worst nightmares I imagined finding your lifeless body. I couldn’t wake you up. You wouldn’t wake up. My darling sister, even now I still imagine your cold body. How can such a deathly and frightening disease exist? You wasted away. Your cheeks were concave, and you didn’t even have to bend over for every bone of your spine to be visible. Your sharp wit and intelligent mind dulled. Your eyes were dark holes in your face. They were so empty. You slept all afternoon and night. I would lay my cardigan over you so you wouldn’t get cold. But I don’t think it made a difference. You were lost to us, floating in some different universe with no anchor or thread holding you to us. And then you tried to end it all. Multiple times. When I think about it, I blame you sometimes. But I know that the blame is not really towards you. It is towards me, of course. I am your sister. I should have been your protector. Is it OK if I say that I couldn’t really do anything but stand there and watch it run its course? Or is that just an excuse?	1
Has anyone else struggled with these thoughts? Does anyone know how to motivate yourself to change when it seems so futile?When people say dont quit SSRIs, listen to them I was put on 20mg Lexapro through my university's health center, but summer rolled around and since I wasnt taking a physical class (online ones dont qualify you for student insurance apparently) I had to pay ~$400 for coverage in the summer in addition to actually paying for my prescriptions. I thought I was in a good enough place (not financially though, obviously) that I didnt even need Lexapro anymore so I started using my remaining bottle and taking smaller doses every day. I went from about 20mg to 5mg a day for a week or two and then I ran out. Fast forward to today (several weeks without) and I feel like i'm having a mental breakdown over every single thing, i'm a 22 year old man and have broken down crying multiple times in the past 2 weeks and have been getting increasingly angry and even violent in some cases. I was kept waiting too long in a lobby at my apartment for mail and I ended up telling the employees to go fuck themselves and ended up throwing a chair. This is all very interesting considering I got on this and xanax because i couldnt even order food wothout having a nervous breakdown. Another instance is when I stubbed my toe and proceeded to trash my entire fucking apartment and even took a machete to my fridge	1
When you listen everyday how useless, bad you're its really pushing me on the edge everyday, 600$ is a threshhold between life and death, i will be able to deal with my 600$ debt i guess in this month, but i dont have enough to rent a room and buy food	1
Once you're in, its impossible to get out.I'm burning alive to keep other people warm. Why do I have to continue suffering through a shit existence for the happiness of others? They don't give a fuck about me while I'm alive so why should I care about how they feel when I'm gone?What Depression is Like For Me. Having depression is like sailing with a hole inside your boat and only a bucket to keep you afloat. Depression is wanting to have friends but are too anxious to go out and stay a while longer. Depression is forcing yourself out of bed, not for yourself but those who count on you. Depression is having an empty feeling inside your chest while your head is crowded with self loathing. Depression is where people tell you "it will all get better" but only hearing the silent whispers of the wind. Depression is where you slowly lose your personality, joy, and interest for those things that you have used to love. Depression is where a stranger tells you "I'll be here for you" and you take it as an insult.	1
I feel fucking trapped.Its over for me, i have never thought that i will have to kill myself over money and my mother https://imgur.com/a/w7VKI8v	1
I cannot compete	1
I feel like she knew that she had be wrong with me in the past but refused to admit it to me. Was this ever a true friendship? Am I wrong for feeling like my heart was torn out because of what she did? Is what she did OK from her end? Was she wrong or could she have been better about communicating this with me? I just don't know how to process what happened and I feel bad but I still feel that if I am going to call somebody a friend, I should be able to talk to them about life without limitation. I do know there are boundaries but just making small talk shouldn't violate a boundary. I am just looking for validation.	0
In my sessions we've been working on techniques to combat both my SA and depression, these include going to places alone such as coffee shops, yoga classes, shopping malls, etc. (Keep in mind I have "functioning" social anxiety where I can physically be around people but I'm extremely uncomfortable the entire time and have a very difficult time interacting with people).. The thought process being that my depression stems from loneliness and my SA contributes to that.. It's been a big step for me to try and go out on my own, but I've been doing it almost every day even though it doesn't seem to be creating any improvement.	1
Today is your birthday and I thought I could cope. But your birthday is just a reminder, a reminder that I am sick. Today is a reminder that I let you go because I didn’t know how to hold on.	1
I'm alone as I type this. I'm sure many people who frequent this sub would describe themselves in that way. I feel over the years I've been getting more and more depressed. I was depressed when in my teens then I hit a lull in my 20s where I just didn't care about much and put things out of mind. Now, I seem to be at a combination of both. A kind of dead, feel nothing type of feeling mixed in with depression. I've been getting angrier as well. Bitter and resentful. I feel like when I was a teen I just thought strongly that I wasn't very great in the general sense. I feel like I now know that to be true. After enough life experience and enough time with yourself you start to see who and what you are.	1
I know that life isn't fair. I know nobody owes me anything, but i hate that it seems like i always end up last. My friend gets to be happy, my other friend practically runs the store now (but not enough to help, because the SM makes all the decisions and she's shitty), but i have the least and i get the least. My staff and coworkers get people to hang out with. Everyone gets to go home to someone that loves them when they fail and gets comfort from that. I don't get that. I am alone, and i have always been. The joy i get is from making other people happy because i can't make myself happy. I want to make these people never have to feel how i do. It's just so fucking unfair that things just seem to work out better for everyone else. I don't know what to do, i don't know where to go, and i don't know how to be happy.	1
Its enough to finish this, i cant move out and im everyday keeping my anger in myself to dont hurt anyone	1
I honestly wouldn't be alive without the drugs pulling me through, I've even started using my prescription pregabalin (lyrica) to get a buzz too ( taking enough to get high)	1
Finished reading a cool book? Are you going to pick up another one and get sucked in again? Don't forget your friends.	1
I guess my overall issue is I compare myself how I was when with her to where I am now, mostly with my appearance. I’m also still very depressed and feel that it puts me below her now. My only real win is that I’ve nearly kicked my drug addiction (mainly weed, I was using it to runaway from my problems) but now I can’t seem too kick my other habits of nicotine addiction and taking any kind of pill or cough syrup just to not be sober. I’ve distanced myself from friends and I simply feel lost and useless to the world. In college I can’t make new friends and just sit in my dorm room wishing I could go back and start over so I could be healthier than I am now.	1
I have never experienced affection, adoration or intimacy.	1
I've renewed my gym membership I'm going back to work soon im making it a goal to quit smoking and excessively drinking to coap with my depression. Hell I've even make it a goal to stop watching pornography and masterbating for the next 90 days. I'm getting off of my zoloft and I'm going to do my best to turn my life around.	1
I lost mostly everything I've cared about in such a short timeframe. My father went from cancer diagnosis to dead in a 3 month time span.	1
I have taken him to the er multiple times in the past couple of months and each time they say that’s nothing is wrong he’s just having bad panic attacks. He won’t believe them because then he’ll go on reddit and see stories of people being misdiagnosed. I’m convinced he’s a hypochondriac.	1
See, I've started not "sweating the small stuff." For example; stuck in traffic? It's okay. Spilled my coffee? Oh, well. My co-worker is annoying? Doesn't phase me. My thought process is like this: when I wake up and feel like dying, at least the spilled coffee gives me something to do in the mean time. Or standing in a queue forces me to be more in the present and not as much in my head. Since I came to realise this, I've noticed an increase in my general mood, or at least I've become better at coping with going outside, shopping etc.Is there a place on the internet that actually helps? This subreddit is flooded with depressed people. The few that do comment, usually only agree with the OP.	1
Thanks.Lost and Alone Hi, I’m 19 and I’m at my low point. Up until last year my life was pretty good, but now everything has fallen apart and I have no clue where to start picking up the pieces... I’ll keep it short, but I found out my parents were getting divorced when I came home from college on spring break. I don’t have a lot of friends and no close friends to confide in. The only people I do talk to are leaving for college soon (I’m staying home now) and the only thing I had left was my girlfriend who cheated on me. I know I’m young and I’ll grow from this but I’m lost and I don’t know what to do..I wanted to kill myself tonight. I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I've had a very rough few weeks with finding myself jobless, financially struggling and fighting with my boyfriend that I decided to write this little note in my phone. (The ending is supposed to sound funny, it was the only thing that made me laugh and give me that final push thought of pulling myself out of this horrible hole I was in tonight)	1
And I want to change that. I want to remove the stigmas and stereotypes attached to mental illness and get people talking. But change starts with me, and that means that I can’t be afraid to share my experiences.	1
Everything is numb.	1
The fact that i am constantly tired and have 0 energy doesn't help me much either. No matter what i do i am never more than average at it.After struggling more than a year I finally cut off all contact with my crush I deleted her from every friendlist, unfollowed her everywhere and basically removed her from my life after years of friendship.	1
I collapsed, waking to a time of no reply. I logged into what made time fly by, and felt the pains of months wash away within seconds. A second half had joined, and I forgot about all the things around me for the next year. Dawn upon myself shined my sleepy public works to let out a shrieking cry, standing over a bin full of scraps and desperation to fix my bleeding innards. I panicked into a corner, awaiting life’s worst terrors. I stood to nothing, and returned to a hamper of depression. I stared at the dusty fan blades fly full speed, breathing in only to glance at the horrid truth.	1
I'm not suicidal. I don't go to sleep hoping that I'll never wake up again (though I wouldn't be upset by it), and I don't wake up upset that I'm alive for another day in life. If I had to describe how I feel right now...	1
please bear my poor English.  so i know the title is kinda vague and idk i felt i wld get some views n advices here. so  it all  strtd from childhood. My uncle  was jealous of dad in evrythng. Dad was adored by all d siblings he wasnt, coz he was grandmas eye n youngest. Actually grandma spoild him...kinda the pampered kid who is arrogant. He had his ways in evrythng.  Ok den marriage,  n kids. not bragging but i must say this...my siblings kinda "got our shit together" den his kids..in terms of academic performance or like social life in general...so maybe yeah that added  Again highr level of jealousy.  He evn said i got 1st rank in my high school  (which i did..nerdy days)coz its a "rotten school". i am in another city too now, not homwtown. Den my uncle sent his kids to outside cities too , but all faild wid single digits. Shame added to jealousy probably . after some time he bought  Hyundai i10 car. after some time Dad bought i20 too...actually the thing is it was the time when we were kinda grown up too  and a car was necessary plus  i hv four siblings so i20...mayb my uncle thought it was kinda a competition..childish i know.	0
Im 1 year and some months in since i started to liberate myself.	1
I forgot to mention. I want to go get help. get put on medication. But the military doesnt accept people who are on anti depressants. What do i do?Hey, I’m a student at university and I think I’m going have depression. I cry all the time for no reason, I feel like my life has no purpose. I have severe self esteem issues and I’m really unmotivated with life. Sometimes I think it’ll just be better to just kill my self, I hate feeling like this:( Cold turkey off antidepressants for over a month. I’ve been cold turkey from my antidepressants for over a month. Sounds stupid to say that I completely forgot to take them for two weeks but I have been doing so many different jobs over the summer that I’ve hardly been home. For the first couple of weeks, I was fine. Now as time has gone on, the suicidal thoughts have returned along with extremely low moments, mania and anxiety attacks. I would NOT recommend going cold turkey. I can’t believe I have been THAT stupid. I’ve just taken my first antidepressant just now. 😞People think I just want attention if I bring my depression up What is the point and why is wanting attention so bad anyway? Who would not want to be told that they matter and that everything will be fine? If I wanted attention so badly why would I pretend to be depressed? Why not just make up a happy story about my day instead of risking sounding like a psychopath?I just took a shower for the first time in 2 weeks, and I just washed my hair for the first time in months. I know that's absolutely disgusting, but Depression has made me lose all will to do anything, and that includes hygiene. I know it's pathetic to be proud of myself for doing something normal people do every day, but I can't help but feel happy about myself.I'm not dead. I'm trying my best now to get a full recovery First off sorry to anyone in this sub who messaged me or was worried about what I posted before. I haven't even come on here besides to see the front page. I didn't hang myself although I was really close too. It would've been my third attempt and even though shit sucks right now I'm trying my best not to. Thank you for whoever attempted to talk me out of it, I read them all. Here's to all of us getting better and living our lives to the fullestIt kinda makes me sad that most of the people on this subreddit are amazing people Nearly every post I've made under my accounts have always gotten really heartfelt replies that I couldn't hope to get from anyone that I've met irl. It makes me sad that these people have to deal with depression, they don't deserve it.All I've wanted for years is to die. Idk how to want anything else anymore I'm not even that stick anymore. I just don't feel like life is worth living at least not my life. I don't want to do anything. Its all just effort. And for what?  It never makes me happy. I might as well climb in bed and never get out of it. I'm not happy anyway what difference if other people aren't happy with me. Whats the point? Nothing is happy in my life and I don't care enough to change that. Theres nothing In this world I want more than enjoying video games and the hype around it again What do you do after a full days work? What are your hobbies, habits, and routines?  What keeps you busy?  When I am not busy and productive is when I get the most depressed.  Keeping my mind occupied is critical, but I also suck with routine in my life.  The only things I routinely do are go to my day job, work out afterwards, and eat dinner.  Other than that it is all up in the air.  Just want to see how everyone else spends their time after an 8+ hour day.I am lost. I do not know what to do. Hey guys. This is my first post here, I made this account because I need to vent and I have no one else to listen to me. To an outsider, my life seems okay: I am married to a great guy, I have a good job that pays well, my family is healthy and I have friends. To me, my life is unbearable. I am not ungrateful and I really do appreciate everything that I have in my life, but it is very hard for me to get out of bed in the morning and live out my day.	1
I can smile if someone makes joke, but it's made up smile.	1
I've been depressed since I was 15. First signs were at age 4.  I found pot and stayed high for 8 years. Clean and sober for 30 years, I never stopped having suicidal thoughts despite medication. So I tried to bury the pain in relationships, which didn't work either. I've been married three times in recovery.	1
But the sorrow is just overwhelming. I feel like this grief is never going to end. I wasn't ready to say goodbye to them. I don't want to lose my mom. I'm not even thirty. I'm not ready to wake up knowing that she isn't with me anymore. I can't take anymore. I have been crying all day.	1
At home I lie in bed and no one talks to me nornally followed by cutting and drinking	1
Sorry for the long story but... as a person that’s been battling depression for the last 13 years, I just feel like if I left the world, no one would notice or even care...	1
If I oversleep I feel like shit, If I sleep too little I feel like shit.	1

One of my main problems is my weight. I know this may seem vain to some of you, but it is a huge problem for me, someone who already struggles with low self esteem. I have gained about 15 lbs in a year, and I cannot control what I eat, nor can I motivate myself to work out. I do not recognize myself anymore, none of my old clothes fit, and I can't seem to be able to do anything about it. Every day, I tell myself, I will eat healthy, I will make better decisions, I will not hate myself, I will not speak down to myself, etc... Each and every day, I fail. This kills me.	1
I'm 23, so still young, but I really wish I could go back and be 19/20 again because that was when I was truly happy. I had moved out of my hometown, had lots of friends, a good relationship, I lost tons of weight and was confident for the first time ever, I traveled and worked for fun instead of working as a means of survival. I loved life, I had so much energy and such a bright outlook on everything and I had a lot of fun.	1
Well, time had passed, we didn't talked about it anymore and we were hanging out and she turns to me and say "What about we did a lil shot ? " (That is the equivalent on Brazilian to "LET'S SMELL COCAINE)i was "What ?" and she "Yea, it will be fun, i will let you do it in my sexy belly if you want" . It's unbelievable how someone so damn pretty and hot and smart and intelligent and perfect could turn into a fucking piece of shit so god damn fast. I refuse the ''offer'' and started to yell at her and started to talk some monstruous shit about it, like "it was because of that you daughter almost died ?" and everything, i was pissed off, sayed some shits that i shouldn't , she say it too but we overcome it.	1
I dont want to kill myself. I just don't want to exist I dont want to exist. I dont want to deal with all these emotions. I hate myself. I know people around me would no doubt benefit with me gone. I dont want to kill myself. It would just be another giant cost to my family who doesn't have much money to begin with. I'm an accident. Nobody wants a fifth kid in their 40s. I wasn't meant to exist so why am I here? If I wasn't here maybe my parents could've bought a house instead of renting their whole life. Maybe buy a car that the bumper doesn't fall off on. Maybe they could have enough money to retire soon. I just wish I didn't have to exist to be a burden on everyoneThere's literally no reason to stay alive it's like, the same things happen again and again. Every day, every night is the same. Lonely sitting home, listening to music, surfing through the internet, crying in the night.	1
Stranger: it really is	1
My mother is a piece of shit.	1
i went to the doctors about this. they gave me sertaline. it made me feel really shitty in the morning. and made me suicidal. they then put me citalopram. that just felt like nothing. no differences.	1
I feel like I'm a piece of shit that doesn't deserve to breathe the air on this earth, and I don't know what to do. My parents are very unsympathetic and judgmental and my brother is borderline abusive. My girlfriend is the only one left who understands me. At this point, it's just me who has the problem, as she's gotten over the whole debacle, or so she says. Her mom even said "ehh, you two were just stressed out teenagers", but I'm still not convinced. I feel like there's something deeply wrong with me. Is there any advice or words of wisdom that I need to hear? I want to get back to normal. I don't know how I'll deal with feeling completely alone again and losing the people close to me emotionally.do people ever find their jobs interesting? you've gone to school and studied and worked hard to get the job you've alway wanted.. is it as interesting as you hoped it'd be before you got the job? or was it just a waste of time?	1
You enjoyed the celebrations. You always had a plan. I loved to help make it special .It was your day.	1
This past summer, for me, was a pretty great time. I was in a relationship with a girl who really made me happy, more than any other one had before. I seemed to be having fun every weekend, whether with her or with some friends of mine or family. I had a lot on the horizon, and a lot to look forward to. I was getting ready to finish up my degree, and it seemed like things were going in the right direction. The only thing that was a problem then was that my job was a third shift job, but it was 3 days a week, and usually 11-13 hour shifts, meaning I had time to do stuff outside of it. But, my then girlfriend and another friend had solid connections that they thought could help me land a much better job where they worked, which would carry me pretty well until I finished school. Things were looking up for me. I was pretty happy.	1
On the other hand, I can’t stand life. My mind...it’s like I’m terrified of living. There’s this dread I constantly feel from living. I know for sure I won’t be able to endure this for a full lifetime. Even a year seems too long.	1
Cannot find work that will suit my long-term heart and breathing issue.	1
Does anyone have this kind of experience?Closer to suicide than I've ever been before I planned on doing it yesterday after school, but I couldn't because people were home. I feel like I would've had they not been there. I decided to take the day off today just to chill out. I don't think I'll have much longer. Even this community sucks. The most up-voted posts are always the most shallow ones like, 'Does anyone else sleep a lot?' Or something along those lines, and the people who actually need help never get it.	1
Everything hurts and I hate everything about life right now. I wish I could just fall asleep and stay in my dreams.I always attract stalkers and it gives me awful anxiety, I'm afraid they might murder me. I always seem to seduce men usually by accident and when I ignore them they stalk me. It gives me really bad anxiety.I am so depressed I don't know what to do Dropped out of school, have been unemployed for two months, have absolutely no friends and spend my days browsing reddit. Every single day is the same. The monotony never ends. Nothing to look forward to. I try feeling better by shopping and eating tasty food but it never helps. I don't know what to do.I think I am depressed but I am not sure I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me but I think I might have depression. 1) I love going out with friends. I am very active person, but lately for example even when I am laughin I suddenly stop and get very sad. I do not know what is wrong but I get very sad and I lose interest in doing everything. 2) Lately I can not focus. I have never been fun of doing homework but I was always doing it. Now I just can't I am just laying bad instead of doing homework. You might say I am been lazy but also I am music producer and I absolutely love music, but lately I just can't. When I sit down I just can't focus on it and I end up going to bad after 15 minutes. 3) I am sleepy all the time and I am sad most of the times. I do not have specific reasons but I am. 4) I  became very insecure. It feel like my friend do not like me. I feel like they do not want me to be around them and I just do not know why. 5) Most of the times on weekdays I am just laying on my bad and listening sad music and I feel like I am wasting my time. Sorry I think I do not make any sense at all but rn I am feeling really bad and can't think properly.Girlfriend attempted to break her arm to avoid going to work My girlfriend began her summer job in a hospital earlier this summer where she mostly cleans and prepares meals for the patients. She has been pretty upfront about the fact that she is stressed during the days and doesn't want to go to work most days. Since we don't live together we see eachother about three times per week although less during summer since work prohibits that to an extent. She has never during our two year long relationship showed any signs of self harm nor depression. However, today i saw her for the first time this week and I noticed bruises on her fore arm. She unwillingly explained that she had tried to break her arm in order to not have to go to work anymore for the rest of the summer. She said that she had had a panic attack and in desperation smashed her arm into a metal pole  in order to break her arm. She promised to let me know if she felt that way again but I am not sure if she is going to. She also made me promise to not tell anyone about it.	1
I hope everyone is doing well, please be safe &lt;3	1
Jesus Fucking Christ. What in the actual fuck? I don't even drink. Jesus Christ. What the fuck. The judgment. Dear fucking Christ I could not believe nor comprehend how this people even came to whatever bullshit thought/idea they came to.	1
I just want everyone to know I am open to honest responses and please feel free to speak openly, I just hurt because I feel like this is when she needs me most, but also might just need her own time to figure her self out. Thank you for your time and help.	1
So about a year I was cycling in the dark and I was hit by a car, I flew over the bonnet and hit my head. I was out for about half an hour, till I regained conscience in the back of an ambulance, and the crews were cutting off my clothes and pumping me full of morphine. Before this accident I had a very good memory, and my parent would say I could talk about anything that had happened from when I was a child. I was having some weird relationships at the time with different people, and I only came out to them after I was in hospital for a month after the accident, I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to worry them. I valued their feeling more over my own life, and I still do that now with other people.	1
Cast down, cast down.	1
I can't control anything.	1
There is so many things I'd like to do but in the end I end up wasting time on the bed.	1
Isn’t it ironic though? I want to go into a career where I study people all day, yet I struggle to actually build and establish friendships. I’m like a people’s introvert, it makes no sense.	1
I believe that I will be prepared for my career when I leave college. I believe that I will find an internship this summer and every summer after that. I believe that I will impress employers with my fantastic resume.	1
Then you'll continue to argue with your mother. Living on the couch. Selling pastries. In entire loneliness. God only knows how long.	1
So just last week I decided just to cold turkey the SSRI. Now, this was a slight test of seeing how I would react to abstaining from the meds (which is an awful idea). Strangely, I have noticed no real change whatsoever from when I was taking it to this past week of not taking it at all.	1

PLEAAAAAAAAAAAASE I just want to die. Please just kill me. I’m having to isolate myself because my mum is getting angry at me for “draining her with my negativity” Does anybody feel like their life is meaningless if they don’t have a relationship or crush In my opinion it feels like love is the only medicine strong enough to cure my depression. Whenever I’m in love or lust I’m on top of the world I feel so good everything feels great, but once something happens to it I fall down this hole and my depression comes back even stronger. I need to learn to be their for me to grow love for myself. That almost seems impossible but I won’t give up and I’m going to work on becoming a better me. Better for myself, better for my life, and kicking my depression away once and for all.help..? Has anyone reached a point in their life where they knew they needed help but wasnt quite sure how to ask for it or even know what it is they needed help with and who they would need to ask in order to figure out what they needed help? not really a depressive question but more of a question i felt might be better in the depression treadMy fiancee is writing a suicide note And i dont know what to do about it.I lost my father recently, and now I have less suicidal thoughts This isn't gonna be what you think it's gonna be.	1
I've also unfortunately had to deal with siblings who are dealing with this tragedy by lashing out and trying to put themselves ahead of myself and my brother. (My sister and other brother). And that's been super difficult. They've said some ugly things that I'm trying to look past at the current moment.	1
Depression and anxiety and all that jazz can suck the fun out of life in seconds. I want to remind you all that even when you really don’t believe it, keep telling yourself you’ll be happy and healthy. I want all of you to, you deserve that at least.Since we all hate the world and how unfair it why dont we all just become humanitarians :) even though the bad outweighs the good at least we we will be helping others :):)Who here forces themselves to act normal because of social anxiety? I have really strong anxiety and depression. To the point where I hate being around people yet I don't like "loneliness". When talking to people I try talking in a normal confident tone. Other than not taking initiative on things you really cannot tell I'm depressed. Horribly depressed lately. Hello, my name is Jay and just like the title says, I'm pretty depressed. Just... Ugh, nothing goes right these days. I've always had issues with depression, but the last two years have been especially hellish. I don't even know where to start, but I think the biggest problem is always being alone with my thoughts. I don't have any friends or people like that, and my hobbies don't even interest me enough anymore to keep my mind off it. I've thought about and tried to kill myself before, one attempt just a few days ago, but I can't even do that right. I don't know why I'm even writing this, but if anyone sees it and wants to know more or anything, thanks for reading.Social media makes me want to kill myself Constant updates, seeing everything in the world that you're not even close to a part of, seeing wealth, friends, family, your ex who has moved well on, friends who have done u wrong but seem to get an upper hand always out of an unfair situation, and laughs all around with everything just looking perfect. I've been sick of it.. since 2012. I deleted facebook and twitter in 2012 (the worst ones imo) BUTtt.. I kept instagram since then and added snapchat all so that society and my friends and people I would meet in the future would not judge me for not having any social media.. hah. It still fucking sucks. I'll never be able to escape it. I'll always see people I dislike even if I block them because a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend always pops up with them on my feed :) Absolutely hate this shit now. I was thinking back to myspace, one of the first social media sites, and it was different bc people didnt have it on their phones really.. now all social media is mobile af. You see it in groups, you see it at restaurants, you see it at work, fuck you see it everywhere. Like I mentioned, I can't escape this anymore. If I delete it all, I'm a loser lol. i'm weird, I'm this, I'm that, I'm somehow maybe creepy. shut up. This shit is a plague. No wonder I want to leave this stupid fucking earthWife complains that I sleeps too much. I wanna say because being asleep is better than living in the reality that is my life, but I don't know how to explain it to her without hurting her feelings. She knows I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety.Life shouldn’t be this miserable Overwhelming anxiety is ruining meExistence is pain... Do you ever feel like you don’t mean shit anyone? Like you just exist and that’s it?....Does depression ever make you feel not alive? Just completely lifeless, empty, purpose-less. On auto-pilot I wish I had friends that would be there for me when I need them. I have felt like shit for a long time and I feel like nobody ever notices it The Last of Us I just finished my second playthrough, PS3 (im poor, sue me bitch). after the part with the cannibals, ellie sat on a bench and didn't talk much. this, in combination with when she says "he tried to..." to joel after she kills david, made me get a bit angry and sad. then i thought about my female friends (few as they may be) and family and how if any ever hurt them in such a way, especially my family, well i think it's better if that's left unsaid. had to pause the game for a min to cry. i never thought i'd be so depressed that a video game could make me cry (and i've played a lot of games, over 1,200 trophies on PSN. only this one made me cry). and in retrospect, i now think i've come to appreciate at least one aspect of my depression: emotion and the appreciation of it. sometimes i can look at someone, there body language, listen to them and feel there pain, suffering and sadness. i now appreciate The Last of Us, life and other people more. although i did feel more alone afterwards (especially since i think it'd be wonderful to find a girl that has a personality like ellie's. never had a gf, had any physical romantic interaction with a girl or even been on a date. i was 12 when the game was released and will probably still be 16 when part 2 comes out, so we ain't dealin with no pedo shit in these christian suburbs) it was definitely worth it.	1
Does anyone want to just exchange some compliments? Hey! I know a lot of you are having a rough time out there, and some of you are having one of those nights where things aren't looking too good. I'm having one of those right now. I think we can all benefit from just a session of telling each other the truth, that we all matter. We are all beautiful. We are all worth it.	1

Been knowing bestie since we were 14 (now 30), we've been through a lot blah blah. In the past year or so, I've sensed she sort of feels envy or jealousy, not sure which. Things like being short in messages (HATE this), not reciprocating advice when I always do (I got accepted into university and she barely acknowledged, just like to hear support sometimes, and then proceeds to try to enroll sooner at same school and tells me, expecting congratulatory response of course, or even advice over guys), being overly aggressive and controlling when she drinks (have cut back going out A LOT due to this); so any who, I don't want to lose her but am at point in my life  where I don't want any negativity, she's been through a lot, and sometimes I feel she needs me more than I need her. I'm stuck but gearing towards letting her go, but just unsure, maybe I'm overreacting? :(A good friend who I feel is brushing me away. I used to like my best friend(she did not know I like her) but she was involved in a relationship ( a long distance one). Around early October, I stopped liking her but still talks to her like nothing happened and still acts as a good friend and recently, she broke up with her boyfriend. I don't know why but by the way she chats with me through the phone, its like she is putting me off or just ignoring me but when we meet f2f, she acts like nothing happened, so what should I do? I feel like waiting it out and act like nothing happened is the best way to go about thisGroup of friends exclude one person and I’m now stuck I between... So I have a group of about 13 friends, some of us have been friends most of our lives and others have joined over the past 10 years.	0
I‘ll start this with some backstory. A friend of mine plays in a band and last weekend I watched them live for the first time, it was pretty small with four other bands and maybe 15 people watched my friends band. Anyway their lead singer is a girl who gave some weird vibes while on stage, but she was also very edgy so maybe it was that. After the concert someone showed me her IG and I thought I‘d follow her. She and approved me and followed back. The first post she made after that was pretty much this summarized: I am having a pretty bad phase of depression right now. I have no motivation, cant take compliments serious, hate everything I do and am overwhelmed with the smallest social interactions (there was more but I‘ll stop here).	1
I'm 22 and I've never experienced depression. I'm a Psychology major and I've taken classes over the topic, but I know reading about it can only give me so much insight. The reason I'm posting on here is because I have a 12 year old cousin who tried cutting herself the other day. She's depressed, says she wants to die, and I am so, so worried about her. She lives a few hours from me and is being watched closely right now, but I plan on going out to visit her this weekend.	1
I've become so engulfed with my appearance (I have BDD and anxiety and depression) that I completely abandoned all other parts of my personality that made me special and interesting.	1
Of course my schoolwork suffered and my gpa dropped below Hope eligibility.	1
Everyday I also remind myself that it will get better. Sitting here alone, sobbing my eyes out while texting this post, I don’t believe it in these moments, but I’m not giving myself any other choice/exception. I will beat this and be happy.	1
Am I depressed or just self-pitying? I don't really understand what counts as depression but I've had no motivation to really do anything since as long as I can remember. Sometimes I get a burst of motivation and try to do something but I give up really easily. It's really easy to say that I'm depressed as an excuse for the way I feel but I'm still able to function so I don't think I can say I am. I still shower, eat, go to work, even the gym sometimes. I'm not really close with my family, I rarely talk to them and its only when they talk to me and I'm okay with that since I don't really feel like I want to or could hold a conversation with them. Friends I have, I hang out with them sometimes but half the time it feels like a lot of work. I have a girlfriend and I cling to her so hard because I'm so happy when I'm with her and when I'm not with her I'm always thinking of her and get sad that I'm not with her. She recently told me that the way I think of relationships is immature and she cant offer that much time to me since she has other friends who need her too and get mad at her for not soending enough time with them. I can't let go of the way I think relatiomships should be and I want her to reciprocate even if I know it's irrational and I don't feel like anything else in life is really worth living for. I'm not suicidal though, there's a few times it crossed my mind but I always think about how I wouldn't really ever do it or start regretting it while thinking about it because what if things do get better? Other times I feel like going to sleep one night and not waking up would be nice though.Feeling trapped in my head First off I'm Autistic, I'm studying at Oxford I'm struggling to remember anything, like anything at all, people, faces, dates, facts, etc. I'm feeling more and more alone because I don't feel like I have anything good to think about. I have a girlfriend, she's in the forces and has a lot of structure and meaning to her life and I like that but I see my life as completely pointless.	1
It’s all because of one girl. Amazing what one beautiful women can do to you. We talk everyday but I can’t help but feel like she thinks I’m a joke. The worst part is, I work with her...Parents don’t care After 10+ years of dealing with my depression alone I showed interest to both of my parents about going to a therapist and they both shrugged it off. I can't make it better I'm tired of nearly every aspect of my life. Changing it for the better would require money.  To get money you have to work.  Work is boring and tedious and makes me miserable. That goes for any job I could realistically obtain. I can't do more than part time.  I'll never have the kind of money it would take to change my life in ways that might make me happier. There is no point to life so why suffer through the misery and hardship? I want to die but I can't kill myself. I'll never have the nerve.  I feel stuck.I'm pretty sure that I'll eventually kill myself at some point in my life unless something else kills me first. It could be a month from now or 10 years from now but I can almost guarantee that that's how I'm gonna die.   I feel as though eventually I am going to kill myself I’ve told a couple friends this. They’ve told me that I need to see my therapist more, and that I need to get back on my meds. But what if I’m content with this thought? I don’t remember the last time I was truly happy. At best I’m content. Most of the time though I’m in a shitty mood.	1
Yikes..  :/	1
Anyways, does or has anyone taken Pristiq?.... and what are your thoughts, concerns, recommendations, etc.....?	1
I don't feel the own love or care for my family or friends. I don't care if something happened to my friends, and I don't care if I never see my loving, caring parents again for a long time, or ever. I don't care to help friends or family with anything.	1
I don’t know. I just feel like this year has just been me slowly losing the only things that make me happy.Need some advice Should I try to fit in by pretending to be cheerful all the time or should I show how I feel?	1
I couldn't stop crying. I cried at work. I tried to get time off, but they didn't offer bereavement for people who weren't immediate family.	1
Then i went on to google to search for blurry memories and depression. And it leads me to "depression and memory loss" and " depression and Alzheimer " . Then i started to shed tears. I was thinking about the day i actually lost my memories. What if it actually comes, What if one day i wouldnt remember her, my mom, my best friends, and even myself ? I was teaching in class when i shed tears. I had to run to the bathroom and cried in there for 15 mins. Luckily noone noticed.	1
People are not perfect and I push them away or worse, I don't and they use me or tease me forever because apparently I'm too kind and I act like a stray animal. What should I do? I'm so lost. How can I escape my dreams? I'm 26 and I don't have any close friends and I end up talking to my cats or my plushy because interacting with humans makes me incredibly tense. I'm on meds. I was beaten, I sometimes talk too loudly or too quietly because I was a shut-in for a year and I can't control my voice sometimes, maybe that's the problem?	1
And sometimes if I am walking late at night  I sometimes think hopefully someone comes up and shoots me or stabs me and this nightmare will be over Nothing. I just don't want to do anything. Nothing is the only thing that ever sounds good anymore. The stuff I study in school is really cool, but when I get home I just want to lay down and do nothing. Smoking weed makes it easier but I know I'm just pushing my feelings away.	1
“However,” replied the universe,	1
My question now is about telling my boyfriend. He knows I have depression and anxiety. I don’t want him to worry more than he already does. At the same time, though, I might need the extra support.	1
On top of that, we didn't get along well. I'm not even sure he knew I cared about him. All the responsibilities fell on me since both my parents were gone for a month. I didn't have time to drive to the hospital he was at.	1
Stranger: by rolling?	1
After some therapy i decided to tell my mother about this. I went for a visit to my parents house and waited until we were alone to tell her basically what i've been writing above. Also told her that the biggest fear i had before doing it was that if i died my mother would also died just out of pure sadness. After we both cried for a while she dropped the bomb.	1
Cheers,	1
Am I just getting older? Can this be a symptom of depression or perhaps something more sinister? I feel like this is something I've always had and perhaps everyone else has too, but lately it just seems too frequent to be normal...I want to open up and talk to you, but my brain tells me it will just make it worse if I do... That's my life in a nutshell, unfortunately.	1
Can depression impede articulacy? Obligatory I've been living with depression (BP2) and anxiety for much of my life as a young adult. It's been stronger than it ever has the past year and a half, and I've noticed many things about myself that aren't in line with who I thought I once was. One of the most significant is how I sound to myself and others. I used to actively attempt to expand my vocabulary as well as possess an ability to articulate my thoughts, but it seems these days, I'm just drawing blanks most of the time. I feel like an idiot and inferior to others.My mom mocks my depression to her friends My mom doesn’t believe I’m depressed even though all the psychologists I’ve been to so far tell her I am - and i KNOW myself that feeling like I want to kill myself all the time isn’t a healthy mindset. I’ve tried to off myself a few times to no avail (without her knowing) and narrowly escaped inpatient. She calls me lazy and ungrateful, complains about how I don’t do anything productive and sit around all day, I don’t eat much if anything. She treats me so awfully and if I retaliate in the same way all of a sudden I’m the bad person. And here’s the worst of it: I heard her talking about me to her friend, laughing and mocking me, saying stuff like ‘oh everything is always wrong for her, poor girl! she says shes depressed but i know she’s making it up for attention so she doesnt have to do work around the house like the lazy bitch she is’ It crushes me even further and at this point I don’t know what to do. I want to kill myself but I have so many goals and aspirations for the future. I’m stuck in this position between so badly wanting to live and so badly wanting to die.I feel like a useless member of my family I may not help as much as the perfect husband would around the house. But, I’d like to think I do a decent share of what traditionally a husband should be doing. My wife is not the most organized person in the world so me and her butt heads a lot when it come to finding things around the house. Car keys, laundry, tools, you name it, they will get lost around the house.	1
\- He doesn't want to do things that we planned to do. We wanted to go for an exhibition and he said we'll go 'next week' but that hasn't happened yet.	1
My mood has just been dipping continuously the past few weeks. I feel so sad and lonely.	1
i haven’t done laundry in a month or so. i wore the same two dirty pairs of pants to work all week - the long ones, because even though it’s been around 95F all week, i haven’t worked up the energy to shave my legs in forever. like sure it’s 2018 and girls can be as hairy as they want these days woo go feminism or w/e but jeannie from accounting noticed when i had two vaguely different socks bc i was too lazy to find a matching pair and i don’t need to give her any more reasons to open her big mouth tbh.	1
You are my best friend, even though I am not always yours. I wish I would be kinder to you, but I probably will always hold some of myself away. Maybe I am punishing myself. I don’t know. No one can say it didn’t take a toll on all of us. You probably don’t remember, but we were going to the corner shop together once. As we chatted, you were vehement that you were a failure. I asked you, what on earth were you a failure at? What life had you lived that you possibly could have failed? And you said: “I failed at life.” So what was the alternative, my dear? Death? I’m telling you, I lived those few years in the fear that you would be taken away from us by your own hand.	1
I am experiencing a wonderful relationship. I am being filled with light and love and I truly feel as though I’ve hit the jack pot. But, for some reason, my depression is working hard to make sure to hide my own happiness from me.	1
That night I got wasted and tried to swallow a whole bottle of caffeine pills at my friend's house. My intention was to induce a heart attack. He was one of the only people that I knew understood what I was feeling, but I never got a chance to tell him how close to the edge I was since his freshman girlfriend and two of her friends were with him that night. Not that it was his responsibility, but I just wanted confirmation that something wasn't right with me. While I was at his house, I tried to stay true to my 'carefree,' 'fun' person that I tried so hard portray while his girlfriend and her friends complimented my shirt and hair. It made me feel like such a fraud. Towards the end of the night, after I had swallowed those pills, my friend tried to get me to throw them up and then drove me to my dorm where I couldn't even find my room. I stumbled around and ran into the RA that had just gotten out of the shower and clung to him. I was scared and confused and felt so alone. I eventually got to my room and started cutting my already scarred wrist with baby scissors. I tried to cut into my femoral artery with those scissors as well, which was entirely unsuccessful. I settled for cutting my knee. At that moment, campus safety knocked on the door. I kept calm when they asked their usual questions, "Have you been drinking tonight?," etc., until they asked me to show them my wrists. That's when I panicked. Started screaming and crying uncontrollably. They escorted me to their office. I later learned one of the officers asked my roommate if I slept around. While I was incoherently yelling, an officer handed me a phone. It was my mom, and I cried that a death of a young man I knew in high school was my fault, and that I could have done something. (Background: His death wasn't my fault in any conceivable way. He OD'ed. I barely knew him &amp; didn't even know he was an addict, but I had a huge crush on him at the time and never acted on it. Through my warped logic, if I had been braver and talked to him, I could have 'saved' him.)	1
Friend A. I have known A for about 10 years now. We worked together for many years. We partied together for many years. We have kept in contact for many years. I didn't see A as much when I moved about a half hour away. Life happens. Things happen. People get busy and I totally understand that. I drive, she STILL doesn't. We still remained friends though.  However..... I am the one who checks up on her and messages to simply see how things are or invite her somewhere. She gets a hold of me when she needs a ride or something. I can't remember a time she has ever just called or texted to say hi and ask me how life is. I like A  because she is pretty easy to talk to. We have had a lot of good times and have made a ton of memories. One thing that I always tried to look past is her utter lack of manners. I don't think in my ten years of knowing her I have ever heard her mutter a thank you. All of the things I have done for her, never once was there a thank you. I have given her tons and tons of rides and she has offered gas money and I never received a dime. I never expected a dime but if you are going to offer it at least honor your word. What really prompted this post was something that happened today. A is pregnant and she is due sometime in January. I hadn't heard from any of our mutual friends about planning a shower so I messaged her best friend and asked If she had thought about doing so. Her best friend hadn't even given it any thought. .... she said if I would like to take the reigns and plan it then she would help but had no interest in planning the party. I thought it was a little odd but I felt like A really should have a baby shower. I reached out to a few more people who I thought might have the same idea and they hadn't thought to do it either. I'll be honest, I am not a party planner. .. not even close. The thought of entertaining/interacting/etc with people makes me super anxious.... BUT all that aside... she is my friend and she deserves to be thrown a baby shower. I have been thinking about ideas over the past few weeks but haven't put anything into motion yet. I get a message from her today over Facebook that says:	0
I appreciate anyone that takes the time to read this, advice is greatly appreciated.overbearing male friend So my [f/18] male friend has recently has become increasingly overbearing, acting as if he deserves to know every minute detail about my life and what I'm doing. I feel as if I'm constantly oversharing and it makes me uncomfortable, but if i refuse to answer  he starts saying things like "is everything okay between us" "I'm sorry for whatever i've done". Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this situation?Is it me? Hello. This is my first time posting here.	0
Even on good days, I can feel like it's in the back my mind. I'm terrified that it will come back, and I won't be able to control it. I'll give in to the thoughts that say I'm not good enough. You'll never be good enough. Everything you've dared to want will slip through your fingers, and you won't even know. All I do is think about how far I've come from that girl who swallowed a dozen caffeine pills. That girl who  thought she'd never be happy. And it gives me just enough strength to deny those feelings and smile.	1
Days ago i had thoughts, good thoughts, bad thoughts, suicidal thoughts, but they are gone now. Same with feelings. All i have now is emptiness.	1
I don't have any plans of offing myself or anything like that. But every day, it gets harder and harder to convince myself that I actually have anything worth living for. The one thought I keep coming back to is how scared my cat would be if I gave her to a shelter or how she'd get by if I were gone. I love my cat, and she doesn't deserve to be put in a situation like that. I feel like she's the only thing keeping me marginally together. The thought of causing her any distress breaks my heart, and one of the big things on my mind all the time is simply making sure she's happy and feels safe.	1
Vitamin D is the sunshine pill that most people are deficient in. This is also much more of an issue in colder areas or for those who cover up from the sun often. The best way to get vitamin D is through certain food combinations and routines in sitting in delicate morning sunlight and in most cases, taking a supplement is necessary to keep this vitamin flowing in your body.	1
Just try. What do you got to lose?	1
Has anyone been through anything like this? Has any one gotten out of their own self created self destructive hell??	1

I appreciate the science behind it, releasing endorphins yada yada, but if I can't bring myself to drink water or get out of bed how am I supposed to go for a jog? If I'm so insecure about myself why would running and jiggling in front of everyone to imagine their sneery comments going to make me feel better?	1
I don't really know what I expect to see from anyone here, but I'm just so lost.My depression is getting worse And the bad thing is that I already did all the things that someone would say to a depressed person. I've talked to a lot of psychologists (for about 5 years or maybe more), psychiatrist, I've been on antidepressants meds, I Meditate every day,I have been on several nofap periods (I broke a lot of streaks btw), I do physical exercise (I used to be a gym rat) and when I'm out I try to be social (I'm out basically only when I go to work or to the gym). But still my life is shit, I don't have friends, neither a gf, social interactions with women are nearly 0 and I think that all of them are bitches. I'm also poor and I don't see any way things can get better, I feel like I tried all the things that should help and nothing has helped . Sometimes I laugh when I realize the absurdity of my life and my situation. I don't really know for how much it can go on like this, I see that the moment when I'll buy a gun and shot myself in the head is coming... A stranger hugged me yesterday I was crying yesterday talking to my professors because I was having an awful day. And this stoner kid comes into the room because he didn’t realize we were having a conversation. He felt really bad and gave me a hug and left. He was definitely high but it made me feel slightly better.These ups and downs are too much for me I finally went to the dr and got a prescription for an AD but I feel like it’s worse than before. My lows are so low. My highs are just feeling normal. I’ve never seriously thought of suicide before but thoughts creep in my mind now. I can’t sleep. Constantly worried about things in my life.	1
I moved with that same best friend where we would also share the space with two others, a couple from Hawaii. We had Skyped then ahead of time in our excitement of moving and we were all excited to meet each other. I had a job lined up for me as a barista, I had a savings plan lined up for what I could and couldn’t spend for money, school would be starting soon, things were looking pretty nice!	1
When I was in spring of 11th grade my mom got sick (Lupus or something, honestly she might be faking it but that’s a whole different post.)	1
You: no but how, like all u can do is sit around. maybe watch tv or go outside and watch birds fly and shit on your head.	1
All around me there's people who have clear career paths and know what they're passionate about, but I look at myself and realise that I don't have that. I have no interest in working in a job for the next 45 years of my life because there's nothing that I'd like doing. I'm doing fine in all of my classes (As in History and Cs in Maths, Distinctions in BTEC Engineering, everything just feels too simple) but I just still get these weeks where I feel worthless and pointless. I get brain fog, I end up teary eyed and can't talk to anybody for fear of looking stupid (I have speech problems). But then when I end up actually talking to others I apparently look happy.	1
I fantasize a lot about killing myself though I don't think I could ever actually carry it out. If someone could just be there for me I'd feel better. But I've given up almost all hope.Ppl i need help or suicide like really idk what to do. I have panic attacks, i am depressed and it is very bad. It lasts for one year...I’m having suicidal thoughts He chose someone else over me again. How can someone be so heartless? He had no concern for my feelings. He just cut me out of his life by saying he never loved me and wanted to be with someone else. How do you recover from that? I’m so angry. It has gotten to the point of me having suicidal thoughts. That’s not the route I want to take because I am a mother, but it’s getting hard to cope. HelpI just want to be someone else Someone who can do an experience the things I can't, and live the sort of life I wantMy boyfriend blocked me I’ve been talking to him about my depression and my feelings, and he usually doesn’t offer the most support. Most of the time I just want someone to listen, maybe hold my hand and tell me everything will be okay.	1
Thanks again for reading and for your patience. Have a great week everyoneI'm numb I've reached a point that I don't feel depressed but I'm not happy i just exist anyone else like this? Embarrassing myself at volleyball tryouts I'm a freshman in high school and we just did volleyball tryouts and they were fucking horrible. I had to wake up at 5:30 to go to them because they started at 6. Literally everyone there was better than me. I fucking hate everything. I'm such a failure. Like everyone was doing actual spikes and sets and shit and I was just there. They probably thought I was in special ed. At least if I had a mental disability I would have an excuse to be so shit at volleyball. I'm probably gonna quit tbh. I've never wanted to die more in my life. And I know you're probably gonna say do your best and I am but my best isn't good enough. This is what I get for trying to be less depressed using a sport. I don't even look like I'm in high school,I'm just a short 5'0 Indian kidUnrequited Love Crept Back Up to Haunt Me First off, I felt the need to create this fake reddit account so that my posts could not be linked to my actual reddit account, and I could vent to reddit without worrying that any of my family or friends will read this.	1
Aswell im a very VERY jelous guy, so im not gonna deny that, and here is one of the issues with this:	1
Stranger: cuz some things dont	1
I began feeling hopeless again, I felt unsatisfied with life. Not just my life, but life in general. Thanks to my love of Anime, Webnovels, Games and Movies I started to wish my life was like that. I know it's childish, but deep down it's just how I felt. I couldn't accept reality, it was too mundane for me and I wasn't satisfied just sitting there everyday just watching or reading things. But I couldn't do anything about it because everytime I try to do something my IBS kicks in and basically cripples me. And I know that even if I try and do something, it's not really what I want. I don't want my life to be normal. All I would really be doing is trying to avoid the pain that it will never happen.	1
yea...theres nothing going to come of this...i know....and theres more variables than can be explained........I don't want to off myself but I keep thinking about itI'm so lonely that I sometimes just want to talk to the dead. I need advice because I'm quite worried. I have a great family and a best friend and I'm super glad to have these people in my life. But, there's just one thing. I have this very lonely feeling and I sometimes just wish that I had a (good) spirit around me who I could talk to and share my insecurities. I am able to talk to the dead and I have seen many spirits before. I haven't seen one in a long time and I'm just way too scared to summon one or anything. (This is also incredibly dumb) I am not looking for a new (real) friend. Just someone who won't judge me. Is this weird? What do i do? Thanks.Movies to fill the hole inside of you Movies I watched because I  felt empty inside but afterwards I felt even worse like I just lost someone	1
So far in your healing process you’ve managed to understand the importance of detachment. You’re making wonderful progress and I hope that at some point you are still progressing. Your existence is for you and for you only. It is not okay or healthy to live solely for another human being. Remember that you are not “incomplete” without someone however that someone can enhance the you that you already are. A relationship consists of two people working together as a whole yet existing as their own sense of “wholeness” outside of the relationship. That is so very important for you to remember for the rest of your life. Remember when you felt vulnerable just a few weeks ago (sometime in November) and wanted to dive into texting that boy in order to make you feel better about yourself? And then remember that you didn’t because you kept your clarity and understood that it was a coping mechanism. Don’t forget that you’ve done that not only once but a few times now and that is exceptional. I understand future Bri may encounter some setbacks and that her well-being might as well be a roulette wheel, but that’s exactly what this letter is for.	1
My husband and I have been together for five years, and are coming up to being married for three. I have made it clear to everyone involved that I don't want children, and I never have. My husband agreed and has always supported and agreed with this decision.	0
I don't want to die. I don't want to be miserable and I want to believe that everything and everyone will be alright.	1
3) I have big dreams but zero motivation in life so I can’t even try to achieve them.	1
This job was beating me down. I trained a lot of our best staff, and i had a lot of associate come to me before management, feeling like i was more of a leader to them than our actual leadership was. We lost a lot of people due to burnout and frustration with management, but i know that i always cared about the people i got to train and help, and took a lot of pride in their success. Even after getting underpaid, undervalued, and shafted at every turn, i always stayed because i cared about the people i worked with and i wouldn't give up on them. One would think that leaving a shit situation would make me happy, but it just doesn't. Despite my 2+ years retail and leadership experience, it's been hard to find another job. Most people offer me less money than i made before (not much) and basically completely ignore any qualifications i actually have.	1
I gave him every part of myself, because I loved him so much. And I keep holding on to things he said, before he forgot what this love really meant to him. And all the love that I gave to him, that never got into him. No matter how hard I tried.	1
I freaked out. My mom completely disrespected my boundaries and said the equivalent of “fuck your social anxiety, do what I want”	1
Strip the world off from labels. People do not mean to be good or bad. Remember that after you acomplish (or not) all your goals we are still people living with other people.	1
I don't know what to do. There is a burning hole in my chest and I feel guilty that I'm the way that I am. Even on the subreddit. I know people feel that people who've a significant other can't be as depressed but I'm swimming at the bottom of the barrel.	1
I'm not exactly depressed, just don't really feel much emotion and I don't relate to people around me. Never been a fan of going out and I've had major problems getting to know anyone (I only have 1 very close friend, besides her). I've always had the feeling that I'm tolerated but not wanted whenever I'm around others, but this chick changed that completely. I actually started to look forward to waking up in the morning and meeting her at uni. On a side note we also like pretty much the same things - similiar music taste, similiar views, similiar feeling of being a reject and ofc vidya games, books and other shit.	1
And I don’t know how to make any of the darkness back up so that I can breathe.	1
That being said, I'm tired all the time. I mean physically exhausted. Which seems to contradict major depression. I get up every day, shower every day, though I don't really want to go to work I go to work and do work with no issue (it's more that I don't enjoy my job that much on most days honestly some days it's super fun it's just one of those things it really has to do with the fact that I'm older and I'm not doing what I thought I'd be doing by this point in my life more than I hate my job).	1
I hope you guys get to feel it too. At least a small breather from drowning in sadness. God giveth and God taketh away, but lately he seems to just be taking from me. I'm tired of it all now. A little over a year ago my Grandfather who lived with us passed away. About 6 months ago my mother passed away. A week ago my father went into the hospital to have open heart surgery done on him, and today he came back and is definitely looking worse for wear. For the time being he can't do anything physical, can't drive, and just looks like he's in pain, and is talking about probably retiring.	1
A family shouldn’t just be there for emergency. A family is thinking of others before themselves, loving one another enough to know them. Am I really expecting or demanding too much?	0
My initial reaction to a diagnosis of major depression and multiple failed suicide attempts has been to run away from everything that reeks of painful memories, both theoretically and literally:	1
How many lives have been lived in pain and died in them? Nobody asks for an existence, it's thrust upon you. What you do with it makes you who you are, but what life does to you typically makes you live an existence of either easier happiness or rolling agony.	1
You: wow u look 30	1
I have a job interview tomorrow morning. One step at a time! I’m determined!	1
TL; DR: I’ve played soccer my whole life, got a back injury two years ago and I still haven’t healed. Doctors say its nothing) As a result, I am very sad but I keep it to myself. I’m not good at anything else. This is how I feel and I have a slight sense I am the only one to think think this way. I am depressed? Help wanted I yearn for the days I was in high school. I felt as if I was always happy and never worried about anything. I am 22, just having graduated from University. It seems each day I am becoming a person who does not want to have a relationship with anyone other then my family. I want to be alone. Happiness to me is being sheltered by reality--alone with my thoughts. I deleted every single bit of social media I had about a year ago (SC, FB, Insta, Twitter, etc) in an attempt to become as alone as possible.	1
Stranger: yeah i guess just be okay with your existence how it is	1
Any idea how to get myself to get up and DO SOMETHING? The sitting around is what is probably making me most depressed, because I watch my life burn down and kind of can't do anything about.	1
I was thinking that what I did wasn't so bad, but maybe I'm wrong. I feel like a bad person. I know this probably ridiculous, but I've also feel like killing myself because being ostracized and dismissed is one of my fears. I have social phobia. Happy birthday! Anyone else hate being sung happy birthday? it feels almost sarcastic  at this point. I know i should appreciate that i have people in my life that want to celebrate that kind of thing, but wearing a obviously fake smile to attempt to hide how messed up i feel inside get's very tiring, very quickly.Does anyone else get very irritable whenever you're hungry? The biggest problem in my life is that I get extremely irritable when I'm hungry. I'll find myself fantasizing about getting in argument or getting mad about something and then kinda snap out of it and realize I'm actually just hungry. Then I get something to eat and I can feel some of the stress melting away, taking deep breaths and shit. This happens every day.	1
[17:23, 1/22/2018] Her: Would you let this go	0
It’s time to re-define mental illness and stick a middle finger up to all the people who tell you that you’re crazy or different.	1
Rant over, I'm going back to bed.	1
Or maybe it will just go away with time since I’m still pretty early on idk but it’s really fucking with me right now Need to talk and I have nobody. Hey all. Just need to talk, really struggling right now and trying to dig out of it. Not really sure what else to do.	1
Have a good day/night everyone !  chronic Illness and depression I have type 1 diabetes and I know it doesn’t seem much but having something constantly effecting your mood and knowing that it will only get worse and lead to further health problems down the track really gets to me...I don’t want to die feeling like I was never loved 47M married to 41F.  We have no intimate life. I feel like this is the life I was given.	1
This letter may be short, or it may be long.	1
Stranger: how old?	1
Today is your birthday and I want to make it special.	1
The social life issue is more simple, I don’t even want to write about it. I need to be more vulnerable to people and go outside my comfort zone, and that’s gonna take a ton of work no matter how you spin it. The first part of this video with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem is basically my entire life in a nutshell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYCz06bS380. Ditto on the dating life, although that might be a little more complicated. I’ve only even felt attracted to one person since my breakup, so I guess there is more going underneath the surface there. I can’t imagine dating anyone in my current state, but man, the ever-present loneliness really drains me.	1
I hate it. It’s not just a “bad mood” anymore. It’s feeling like I’ve lost my way, and there’s no signs to get back. Like a loop I can’t get out of. That’s why suicide comes up as an option. When you’re stuck in a loop, the only solution is to shut off. If sleeping is the only thing I enjoy, then why won’t I sleep forever? Fuck that shitIm worthless I'm going to just assume nobody will read this like everything else I post here but here it is I guess. Im a junior in college, I've been single for 5 years, and I struggle with things everyone seems to get. I'm worthless to the world, what do I offer? I just failed a statistics quiz and went to my car and wept for 10 minutes. I don't know why. I feel alone all the time, and I feel like I can't please anyone no matter what I do. I just feel like if I disappeared the world would sigh in relief. It's not like anyone would notice me being gone. I don't have a girlfriend or anything like that, because let's be honest, what girl wants to be with a loser who has to work twice as hard as everyone else. I want to die. It feels like I'm on an island by myself and I just want to end it. Just when everything was getting better, here I am, contemplating how alone I am in this fucking world and how I can just get out. How I explain my depression to other people “Do you know that feeling when your alarm clock rings, and you don't want to get up, do anything, see anyone, you just want to turn off the world? Now imagine you have that feeling every morning, and it never goes away. It stays with you, in the morning, day, night, when you are with friends or alone. You try to get rid of it, but nothing works.“Does anyone else get such intrusive thoughts like “I hate myself, I should cut myself, I wanna die” that are so intense you have to say it out loud? Sometimes when I get into a cycle of negative thoughts they are so strong and it’s just automatic that I say it out loud. Sometimes if just comes out as an “oh my god” but other times I actually say those thoughts to myself. Physically telling myself that I’m stupid, I have no worth, I wish I could die. Does anyone feel this compulsive need to say their thoughts out loud?I've been having suicidal thoughts more than ever... I feel like I fail at everything, I don't have any motivation to clean or really do anything. I feel like I'm no good at anything and have gotten really lazy. I'm not the best wife and I've made many mistakes. If i asked my husband to do something and he didn't I'd complain to try and get help. If he's not doing anything I wouldn't either. Now that he's moved out I feel like I don't really have any reason to live. I used to smoke weed but had to stop a little under a month ago cause I got arrested (on my anniversary) and am facing felony charges on something that's legal. I've had to hire a lawyer and everything to try to keep my record clean. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was in high school and kind of turned smoking a bowl into my medicine so I would always refuse depression meds. I've heard mixed things about them, and I'm scared on how they would take effect on me. But since the arrest I've been getting progressively worse and worse. My husband was the one who initially got me to quit hurting myself and the thoughts keep haunting me more than ever. One of the biggest reasons I haven't been able to bring myself to doing it again is I care for others more than myself. I couldn't hurt my friends and family like that but I'm mentally going insane...Deicide - This is hell we're in Racing with death, life in a mess Time growing shorter with every regret Efforts subceeding, I'm losing restrain Insincere promise I've broken again Nothing can touch me for once I am dead Exclude the body, the spirit is left I have no problem in coping with life It is this world that condemns me to die	1
About three years ago, I used to feel excited about everything. Finishing school, starting my studies at a university, being self-sufficient, finally doing what I thought was my future career.	1
Back then in uni days, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and was put on medications. I've been off them since my graduation, because I didn't want to depend on them for the rest of my life and I didn't really have the funds to continue the treatment back then.	1
In two days I'm shutting down the case I opened to try to get help for my daughter.	1
Love yourself. Respect yourself. Appreciate your own time. Respect others. Respect other’s need for space. Live for you. Again, love yourself.	1
I absolutely never signed up for this.I want to feel good about myself That's all I want. I want to look myself in the mirror, see all of me, the good and the bad, the past and the present, the regrets and triumphs, and just tell myself "This is me, and that's good"Whenever something good happens in my life, I feel like I don't deserve it. Anyone feel this way?Does anyone else get droopy face When i feel extra crap (half the time) my face and eyelids feel heavy. I'm sure it's the mood cos i don't get it when I'm feeling ok. I used to get my whole body feeling like that when i was super depressed...Why did they forget me? I was never someone people would consider anti-social. Rather, I was the opposite. I loved talking to people, meeting new people, and just being social. In highschool, I never had a "group" of friends per se, but I knew almost everyone in my grade, and was friends with a lot of them. After high school, I went to a local university, so I'd have to commute to my school, unlike the rest of my classmates who went to to schools further away. My current university is a huge commuter school, so there's no on campus experience to be had, and I'm actually transferring to a local community college instead, so I can transfer out later. Through all this, the friends I had in high school have all kind of forgotten about me. Even in high school, I'd be the first to message people, or the one to initiate hangouts and whatnots. But now, in college, its the same but so much more lonely. All my friends are away, and I'm rotting here. I feel so alone. On top of this, I miss my ex from a year ago. We went from meeting, to best friends, to huge fallout, to reconciliation, to best friends, to dating, to nothing. I miss the friend part. This loss has dampened my mood for a year now. Just overall, I feel so lonely. A year ago I felt on top of the world, and now, I'm back to shit. All I ever wanted was someone to message me first saying "Hey dude, how are ya?" Its been a while". The worst was Thanksgiving break, where I had excitedly messaged a few people saying I'm so happy to see them and we (read: I asked to) made plans to hangout. A lot of them fell through. Others postponed till Christmas break. I messaged 28 people one day, desperate to talk to someone. I feel like I will never be anyone's "everything" ya know? I want a dog. Not just because its cute and all, but I want a companion that will never forget me, and will love me. I hate myself. Depression sucks. Loneliness sucks. I just want to cry.I've never liked myself. Honestly, I think that my entire life I've been depressed, but now that I'm older (19 y/o), I've realized what it actually is. All my life I remember hating myself and wishing I could be somebody else. I thought it was normal. I always envied just about everyone else and thought the worst about myself and every action I took.	1
I can't eat, I can barely sleep, I'm either furious or depressed.	1
tl;dr my 12 year old cousin is depressed and attempting to hurt herself. I'm going to visit her this weekend. Is there anything I can do (or shouldn't do), that might at least show her that things can get better. It feels as if I'm heading towards a dark place Hey, haven't been here before but I had a quick scroll and this feels like the right sub to vent to. I'm 18 from the UK, I've had a rough educational life (I alway talked, went in high with my friends, got in minor trouble that kinda thing). I fucked up college in the second year of my 2 year diploma course and got excluded for the same kind of shit previously mentioned but on a larger scale, this really fucked me up as I thought I'd end up doing nothing with my life when I really wanted to do something with it. 10 weeks ago I got a job and a paid for graduates course which pays out over £1100 per month after tax which is incredible for me, it's a job I love, work hard at and it's exactly the path I want to take in life career-wise. So I've been given a second start, I have money, great friends, a good social life and my life is on track but I still can't quite feel complete. I'm very social anxious and this affects my everyday life but I push through it, I have to. I smoke week almost everyday and I've been smoking for about 5 years now. The problem is, I still have a void that I can't fill and I can never really feel that happy by myself. I love my metal and I'm a huge music fan, I used to play a lot of games but I've stopped caring so much now. Sometimes I find it hard to enjoy things as much as I used to. I feel exhausted at home as I don't sleep much and the anxiety takes it out of me until I walk through the door. It feels as if it's getting worse and I don't know what to do and I don't even know why I feel this way. Sometimes it can get quite bad where I won't even feel like doing anything but pulling bongs with the TV on in the background as the day is just too much to handle sometimes.	1
[13:25, 1/22/2018] Her: You?	0
I don't know, I guess I just want to lay down for awhile. Dream it all away. Pretend that life isn't bearing down on me or that I am happy. I just want it to be over. All of it. Just take me home, wherever that be.3 days left I'm going to commit suicide on April 1st.	1
I don't know how to be happy like I was again. I look at old pictures from times past with old friends, destinations I went too and I want to cry because I just wish I could go back. I'm so depressed and hate myself, I'm incredibly lonely and am just a shell of the person I used to be. It's like I'm mourning my past life or something.Sick of overthinking everything Wish I'd just shut the fuck upI made a word cloud of all my depressive posts over the past three years. https://i.imgur.com/hNbtyW4.png	1
You: how are you okay with that?	1
Did depression ever cause you to only see the negative aspects of your SO? Like you thought to yourself: "His nose looks weird" or "I don't like his hair" or "His teeth aren't even". Things that didn't bother you before... Or that you didn't pay attention to but now now you do?	1
drinking alone who here likes to drink alone but doesn't tell anyone they do because their ashamed people will mock them for doing so? what else do you do to feel good other than drinking? I really need some advice *trigger warning* *trigger warning*	1
Stranger: gotcha	1
I’m reading what I wrote and it’s kind of frustrating. I clearly have dreams and desires, why can’t I manifest them into anything that makes me remotely proud of myself? Like am I even depressed? I feel like way too many people here have it worse than me for me to complain about my “depression.” Maybe I’m just a shitty person looking for an excuse not to do anything useful with my life.	1
Mr Nobody (especially this one)	1
You: how bout you? are you coping with life by smoking?	1
I spoken to therapists and friends, and anyone i can. I just dont know what to do, no matter what i have to work. its just the way it is. but every single day i wake up and think why stick around, why be here doing things i hate 90% of the time just so i can complain about not getting a life for the other 10%. I just cant believe people are okay going into work everyday. its like being pecked to death by a duck. I have all these things i love, that make me happy and i just dont get to do them, and everyone acts fucking beffudeled that i feel this way. i do not get to have a life. no one does. we work for other people who are working for other people and it goes all the way up like that untill you get to the donald trumps of the world who where born with a silver spoon shoved sideways up there ass. How can people feel okay about this. ive taken drugs ive worked out everyday ive followed all the advice but it just doesnt change reality. I dont even know why im posting ill just get the same "try going back to college" bullshit, i know exactly what i want, it is simply unobtainable.I really just don't want to be alive anymore I feel so alone. I just want it all to stop. Forever. I'm just worthless garbage. I don't know why I keep posting here like it's going to help anything. I want to flip my car so bad. I'm just making everyone's life worse. No one actually wants me here. They just feel bad for me I guess. Who knows.Finished my goodbye letters. Would just like to vent a little before I hang up my hat... For the last two months I went through hell with my relationship to my GF that I was planning on proposing to right before this all began. Since May she's been telling me how she's depressed and doesn't know why and that our relationship is failing because of it. I did absolutely everything I could to help even changing so many things about myself. This went on for over a month until she said we needed to take a break which we began to and for the next month we were on and off yet still living together and in my eyes things were turning around for the better. Well, June 29th I found out the reason for all this was that she was talking to a co-worker that lives down the street and began sleeping with him while I was at work. Unfortunately I snapped and went to confront the guy which she blocked the door from me leaving and I just ripped it open hitting her with the door not even thinking bruising her shoulder. 4 days later she calls the cops and 2 days after that I'm arrested for domestic battery. We were planning a life together and I've never felt so betrayed. After a couple days I began to see the light and once I did my mother had a heart attack and I can't help but blame myself for putting her through all this stress. Normally if I had family problems I would turn to Kaitlyn my GF and if I had GF problems I would speak to my mother or my brother who lives half way across the country. Well, now I have no one to turn to and I'm spiralling out of control. Last night I spent a few hours writing my goodbyes and have been collecting a variety of sleeping pills and muscle relaxers. Im gonna try and enjoy the next couple days and then I'm pulling all my money out of the bank to go find a beautiful scenery and make that my last memory. You've always been a huge help Reddit over the last few years but this is my breaking point. If convicted which I most likely will be according to my lawyer then the rest of my life is tarnished and getting a good job will be next to impossible. Hell I'll probably lose my current job once my name begins to get drug through the mud... Idk where I'm going with this just really needed to vent to someone that isn't gonna just tell me keep your chin up and things will get better like my friends and family. They just don't understand the dark place that I'm in right now. I've dealt with what I believe to have been mild depression for about the last 15 years living in a very racist area and being half fillipino and half white. I've never truly felt like I fit in anywhere and am just tired. I'm ready for peace. Up, down, up, down, up, down. I can deal with being sad and depressed, but it's the false sense of hope and happiness before getting kicked in the dirt again that kills me. I can't be happy or satisfied anymore, I know it won't stay.Feeling insecure that my friend hates me I'm really stressing out right now. This happens all the time, I feel like my closest friend hates me. But recently, it's been getting bad. He's been ignoring me in person, taking forever to text back, and being really passive aggressive while texting me.	1
*You just.. can't.* Finally on the path to getting myself back. I had a really bad panic attack last night that came out of nowhere and it enabled me to visit my doctor today and talk about my depression. She gave me some prescriptions and referred me to several therapists.	1
I just turned 27 I have been in university since I was 18, trying to finish a four year degree,  I was on my way to be done university May 2016 and then as per usual I needed extensions for all of my last four courses.... that was almost two full years ago.........  I still have three more papers...	1
I feel like I'm living in my head 99% of the time. I catch myself forming conversations in my head between me and other people. It's pretty obvious because my lips move and I tend to smile when this happens. (A couple of my friends have pointed this out) Sometimes, the conversations are just between me and myself. I feel very numb during this whole process. The topic of these "conversations" revolve around feeling worthless in every aspect. It feels like life is against me. I'm average in every way (looks, intelligence, skills). I feel like I will never amount to anything. I just do things to get them over with, just so that I can continue to keep to myself and get stuck in my head like this. I don't have pride in any non-school/school project or assignment I do. Even things that should be enjoyable, like going out with friends doesn't really do anything for me. It feels as if nothing brings me joy, except numbing myself out from everyone else.Today is my 21st birthday. I'm spending it alone with a bottle of wine. Birthdays have always been a bit of a sore spot for me. To quote a very old comment of mine,	1
Unfortunately I have to see her in May for my girlfriend’s prom, they are in the same senior class and I an currently a college sophomore. I still feel as though I am in a rough place and don’t physically look as good as I should. Stuff such as my teeth and acne and other results of that loss of hygeine that I still struggle with makes me feel like I have been doing worse than her, which I know shouldn’t matter but it still bothers me. I’ve tried getting my old habits back which work for a month and then I lose track again.	1
Okay, yeah, I admit, I used google translator, goddamnit, for your stupid nonsense article, how fucking awful is that? The translation is accurate and shit. Well, awful enough for the sole reason of using it. Oh well then, sorry for wasting your time. I got rejected from a call-centre - a place where homeless fellows shouldn't go. Things never go my way, man, I cannot stand it, but I'm supposed to, fucking ridicolous.	1
I had a pretty bad childhood that I try to justify my problems with (dealt with a lot of sexual abuse and my mother died in 2013) but when I'm having these 'days' I'm not thinking about anything in particular that would make me flighty. I ended up admitting a lot of my past to one teacher last week who I admire greatly and whom pretty much just saved my life and I am still cringing today. I know I have no reason to cringe either, I just get so nervous of social interaction.	1
I feel stuck. I wish i had someone as an anchor to support me but i dont have people i feel comfortable telling things to.	1
Thank you for listening to me and thank you for being you.  I appreciate you and I'm sure others do too. I hope you can find it in you to appreciate and help others.  Have a lovely day. I don't know what to do anymore. I really don't know what to do anymore. It's just too hard. I try to be positive and act like nothing is bothering me but that doesn't help at all. Everyone says it's supposed to get easier, but it doesn't.	1
I'm sure I'm not alone in this regard, but I feel like 90% of all potential comments and posts on reddit I make are deleted before I post them.	1
I’m not sure if this helps or hurts me here- but, I’m not really into anime or gaming (I thought I would throw that in there because of the people on here seem to enjoy those things) A lot of people also tend to be into computer science, and that’s okay! But, I’m going to tell you now that I’m pretty technologically impaired so I won’t be able to hold a conversation about it with you :P	0
Well, it's late (like 3 in the morning) and this is the time when I'm usually in my feelings. If you've invested time to reading my story this far, I thank you and would like to know what you think about my situation. I'm a bit dramatic, and I overthink like a muthafucka, but I'm an honest fellow, and this is first time venting to reddit. And it's a bit ironic, cuz I should get some sleep since she's coming over tomorrow.	1
Looking for people who are generally online from 10pm-1am central time. Hopefully I can move back to /r/anxiety but the last three weeks have been more brutal than in a long time and I'd love to be able to talk to people who won't make me feel insane for some of these thoights.No hope There is no hope left for me. The sun doesn't shine. There is no light in my life. There hasn't been for awhile. All I do is go through the motions and I give up even doing that. Why don't I have the courage to end it? Body: Anterior pelvic tilt So i have APT and im really skinny and its been fucking ruining my life. For more than 1 year ive always thought about my body and i obesses over it. Ive been going to the gym now for 1 month of personal training and not a single difference at all. Not a tiny bit fitter not a tiny bit stronger or anything. Im so fucking depressed. I see people who dont go to the gym and they have muslcey bodys and im like wtf? I feel like everyones a fucking bodybuilder. Its been killing me. My back is like an S shape.Is it better to find out your love was a lie, or never to have loved at all? Last year, after 16 years of marriage, my wife says she never loved me, has never found me attractive (who can blame her), and doesn't think we've ever been right for each other. She only married me because she felt pressured from family and church to get married, and I was a "good guy", as she puts it. This crushed me. She has been everything to me. I have always loved her so much. My whole marriage has always been a fairy tale for me, it was everything I wanted. This was the girl of my dreams. I remember thinking when we were dating that it was too good to be true that any girl, especially one as amazing as my wife, would ever like me, since I'm shy, boring, and ugly. I guess I was right, it was too good to be true, and I should have trusted my gut and known it back then.	1
So Im ready to fuck it all and just tell my parents Im an atheist.  Let them send me to whatever fucking counseling they want. Let them disown me and have to go live with a friend. I have no future other than a goddamn walmart greeter at this pointexhausted this is my first time posting on this subreddit but I need something to regurgitate everything that I’m feeling as it may be the only thing that stops me from trying to hurt myself. I’ve only slept for about 2 hours and I have to be up for work in 30 minutes which is making me feel worse. As my depression has gotten worse, I find myself sinking further into a place where I have no desire to help or look after myself. I still live at home with my parents and since my mom is aware of my attempts to hurt myself, she has taken on a lot of the responsibilities that I once had for myself. Like cooking for me, cleaning for me, taking me to work sometimes, sleeping in my bed with me. I feel so fucking bad about that, I feel bad for her and I feel bad that she’s really the only person. I have my boyfriend who has been as supportive as he can be, especially because he’s dealing with his own obstacles and  I feel like I’m incapable of being there for him. I keep having thoughts of breaking up with him and becoming so sensitive towards everything he says and it makes me beyond words angry at myself that I have failed him and our relationship. I can’t make me happy, I can’t make him happy and I won’t make anyone happy ever. I am attention and reassurance seeking, I get so angry at the successes of others because I’m not good enough. My identity is shattered and especially because now all I can think about is how sad I am. If I’m on this downward spiral now, will I ever get out of it?? If I have to live with this any longer, I really don’t want to live anymore. Everyday I entertain the idea of being in a car accident because I want people to take care of me and love me but I also hate that I want that and wish so badly to be okay with not needing validation and approval from others. I attempted to overdose recently and all I thought about was someone finding me dead on the floor and hoping they would feel bad. I couldn’t even think of how this would affect my poor mother who has been through so much with my ungrateful attenuation seeking ass. Im so grossed out with myself. I’m eating at myself and letting myself go, I keep picking and scratching and slapping myself because I don’t think I deserve to get better. I deserve to hurt because I’m a sad sack of shit who has NOTHING to be sad about. I have everything I could ever need in life and I’m still complaining like an ingrate. I fucking hate myself so much, there is someone out there who deserves my own life more than I do. I’m going to start antidepressants I was prescribed re cently and am in therapy (I don’t go as often as I probably should) and while that is good, I’m almost scared of getting better just to get worse again. I’m scared of going on antidepressants because I’d rather feel so much than feel nothing at all which is my predicament. If this doesn’t work, if I keep waking up depressed and if I continue to get worse, I really want to just die. I have no friends, they all live far away and I think they only care because I think they can tell I’m depressed based on some statuses I’ve posted. My boyfriend continues to be loving towards me, but I always feel like he only does now because he doesn’t want to hurt me. He says he wants me to get better and be more confident, and I can’t help but feel that maybe he deserves someone who is more confident. He reminisces on the past and is always talking about wanting to travel and I can’t help but feel so bad thinking that I won’t be involved in those plans because I’m not a fun person to be around. People have reassured me that I am more than enough but I’m not, I’m not I don’t believe them. They’re just saying that	1
Recently started again, but Im just finding that I had hoped id feel so much better so much faster and It just feels like I am so raw...	1
I am just completely exhausted at this point and don't know how much longer I can take it. My parent just keep telling me I need to get a job, like that would make everything better. It definitely doesn't help that they try to get me to go to church with the every other week or ask me all the time if I have met any girls that I'm interested in. They can't understand that just taking a shower on any given day or leaving the apartment to buy groceries is a monumental task.	1
Today your birthday and I can’t tell you I love you. My wishes for you drift off into the empty void of your absence.	1
I think the only reason i'm scared is because society tells you suicide is bad and my religious upbringing taught me that it's sinful. I don't care about any of that crap anymore, i don't care about anything or anyoneOur teacher made us read about a child that invented a lead detection device. Meanwhile I'm failing classes. I don't know how to write this. I feel like shit. I'm in class. I cannot focus now. Gee, thanks, teacher! Even though I even said it out loud and personally told you, you STILL INSIST on making me feel like shit. Giving me a C because I didn't do one assignment is not enough, is it? You NEED to do this to me? That girl JUST HAPPENED to research on how to build the thing from the MIT website, meanwhile I cannot even think about going to my dream school (MIT) because I'm too scared!	1
Everyone around me is just carrying on like normal.	1
So how do I make a change in my own life toward fighting this black hole of being digitally programmed, force fed fear, and made too wallow in my insecurities. Get out there and meet people of walks of life and commit an hour of my time each day to an individual who could use a human interaction.	0
What followed is 3months of applying to anything I could reasonably walk to (I was trying to search within 5miles) because transportation in the part of Georgia I was in was a huge deal and I could not get around.	1
Sry for the huge wall of text but I'm trying to get this typed quick as I'm about to go out. I don't even know why I'm posting this really, I want to vent, maybe I want advise. I don't know, the fact that I'm even posting this means it's starting to get to me in some way. A depressing poem. My lips betray, They belie the scream piercing my mind, “What’s wrong?”, “Nothing, I’m fine.”Hello Hi, I just wanted to post a hi for some reason, I'm not having a good week, its a little bit bad week and I'm feeling sad, so hi!I give up I lost my aunt my uncle and now my dog I have nobody at my side I'm done life is not for me periodDoes anyone else dread going to bed at night because you're forced to be alone with your thoughts? I drown myself out during the day with reddit, podcasts, audiobooks, music, TV, etc. I make sure there's never a moment of quiet otherwise I start thinking about how much shit sucks. But when I'm laying in bed trying to sleep I'm forced to be alone with myself and actually think about things. It sucks.I am okay, until I have to be alone with my thoughts. I enjoy the company of my friends, even though I'm very bad at talking to them. When I'm out with them or rehearsing with my band I feel okay. I almost feel depression free for the time being— I feel like everything will be okay, that I got this, that I am in control, that it doesn't matter that I have a lot of homework due in the next week cause I'll go home and get it done. I feel strong and motivated.	1
Please help.Someone just said “happiness is a choice” to me. What are your guys thoughts on this opinion/argument?	1
Lost in translation	1
I've been thinking a lot more about suicide and I'm already sure I am too cowardly to really do it but I think about it a lot. How it'd hurt my wife but I think it'd be good for her to find someone else. I just don't see the point in continuing. I'm an adult now but I never learned how to properly be an adult.	1
Thank you for reading.	1
Make them laugh, you’re a clown.	1
My husband and I are on the same page that our relationship and boundaries need to be the priority but love our family. We do not have childrenNeed advice on helping a friend escape an abusive dad A week ago, my best friend Jake (not his real name) confided in me that he has been physically and emotionally abused by his father since childhood. We are both 17 years old and we have been best friends for 4 years. I was really shocked when I found out because everyone in our high school friend circle sees him as extremely seemingly cheerful and upbeat. I'm his best friend, and I never suspected anything was wrong. This morning, he texted me saying that he was running away from home. He told me he left his home with a backpack full of clothes and $100 that he had secretly saved up without his dad's knowledge. I'm very worried about him. On the one hand, I think he should get out of that dangerous situation as soon as possible. On the other hand, I think it will be very difficult for him to survive on his own with so little money. Any advice on how I could help him as a friend?  I’m tired of pretending your sexually explicit jokes are funny I’m a lady, but I’m also pretty chill and a total bro. Sometimes, I think the sexually explicit memes are funny, but recently that’s ALL my guy friends talk about. It’s getting annoying, and plenty of other things are funny too that we can talk about. How do I tell them I’m getting tired of “send nudes” and “bobs and vegana” jokes without being “that girl who can’t take a joke”How I'm coping with the end of a friendship... I'm writing this partly because I find it therapeutic and partly because I'm hoping it'll help others.( I have self-proclaimed good coping skills.)	0
This is the beginning of the end.	1
Stranger: true lol	1
She had been struggling with depression all her life without me or my sister knowing about it and it came a point where she even tried of doing the same. The thing that stopped her was their children and what we would do with 12 and 8 years alone. She also told me that my grandfather didn't die of cancer, apparently he was an alcoholic, and when we where kids he threw himself at the well they had on the backyard.	1
I'm already trapped in an endless loop of thinking about my ex, who I still love and miss so much, and beating myself up. Searching for answers and ways how I could of been a better person for him. He told me he hated me and that I made him feel like a child. But i never intended for my help to make him feel like that.	1
Stranger: and mauybe od eventually	1
Then he tells me that he feels like a she. I loved her no matter what. I told her I still loved her and that she’s going to be one of the most beautiful girls ever. I still planned to propose. I loved her more that she’s her true self.	1
I left the state to work on the crab boat. For 5 months I lived in isolation, either working or chain smoking weed to keep myself from ruminating on all my failures. The crab boat did almost kill me. Multiple times, in fact. In the end I quit, not because I was suddenly afraid to die, but because my captain was the most sadistic piece of human scum I'd ever met, and I couldn't take him any more.	1
Stranger: country*	1
It's a silly sentiment but it's all I got right now, I hope it reaches someone else who can benefit from hearing it. If you pray, pray for me in the next three months because it's  all I got. Ask me for some nice nice words and I'll give some to you as personally as I can. Things get better when you're kind to others. No matter what the haters might tell you.Anhedonia.. anyone else experience it? I just want to vent and have some insight.	1
I'm not depressed. My brain ain't malfunctioning; it's as valid a pattern as any. The uncaring universe approves of my mind as much as anyone's. I'm just not biologically equipped to thrive in the environments I find myself in.Anyone get this feeling? Does anyone else get the feeling like you're waiting for something to happen? Something great that will change your life for the better and make you finally happy. But you realize that there's no "thing", this is it. What is that? I feel like this all the time. Like I'm waiting on that thing to finally happen to fix it all.. Alone in a room full of people It’s the worst feeling. I feel it all too often. girl So in the past 2-3 months i been talking to this one girl. I love everything about her and we really clicked together, seeing as we're both socially retarded. Literally everything's been looking up, i started working out, being generally happier and more carefree even in social environments.	1
I dunno, I know that so many other people are having a rough time and I should be happy with how things are going, but I'm just down right now.Hey reddit, give me one moment. Take a deep breath.	1
The difference is, that depression makes you NOT want to get better, or more accurately, not care about getting better. Sometimes, you're just apathetic and nihilistic, "What's the point? I don't care. Getting better is too much effort." Sometimes, you just want to wallow in your own despair. For me, when I feel this way, it's because I feel worthless and self-loathing. I think, "I deserve to feel this way. I deserve this emotional pain that I'm going through. I don't deserve to feel better, or to be happy."	1
But I just sit here. Heck, if I'm procrastinating so bad, at least I could have fun, party, travel, meet people, see the world, at least not waste my time or waste it in a way that's at least fun! But I'm still sitting here. Like in a shock. It feels like it's too late for the studying thing (exams are in spring and I have no idea about the subjects and skip all classes I'm paying for) and I have no idea what else to do with my time.	1
Anyway, I just sat around with my pup and ate too much and watched tv so it is what it is.How can I get out of an almost constant state of dissociation? A majority of the time I’m just in a state of dissociation. It’s difficult for me to describe, but it’s like I’m just not mentally there. It’s like a constant state of autopilot. I’m there but my mind isn’t. My mind is always so foggy and difficult to navigate through. Most of the time, I’m just mentally empty. I used to never be like this but I can’t remember what life was even like before this. It’s been like this since I was 14. I’m 19 now and I want to get out of it badly but I don’t know how I can. I'm just so fucking lonely and I'm tired of pretending I'm fine Fair warning I'm about to just spill out everything I have bottled up into this post	1
During this I still went to school, cooked, did my laundry, and did kind of normal kid stuff.	1
The only thing I could ever really destroy is myself. The thought of my life slipping away becomes more attractive by the day as I see how impossible my desires are and how completely fruitless any effort to change is sure to be, just like it always has. I can’t handle the responsibility of being alive and I don’t want to anymore. I’m just here for the hedonistic pleasures life sometimes offers, until either I or something else kills me.	1
Anyways, maybe beating cancer isnt really something to be "proud" of. I'm no fucking warrior. I'm terrified about the whole thing. The people I care about think I'm brave but in all honesty I brush it off because I would rather take it again and again just so they wouldn't. I'm.just trying my best to take it day by day, but it's getting harder and harder to deal with everything.I walked out of a job yesterday. I took my 'dream job' in early January, only to discover that it isn't my dream job at all.  I thought I would like working in a medical office, but this particular medical office has two doctors, one part-time staff member, and a cluster of other problems.	1
Now, I am pro-life, and pro-choice.  I gave her that choice, and she wanted to go ahead.  I didn't force her or convince her.  She led me. She set me up, just to rip out my heart.	1
I have no passions in life. I have no hobbies. I'm not passionate about my family, friends, work, school, boyfriend, hobbies, my Jeep, animals, etc.. NOTHING excites me, brings me happiness or joy or peace. OCD, anhedonia and depression control everything.	1
So yeah. Thanks for reading, stranger. Sorry for the inconvenient text wall. Hi! We are YourAmigo Hi!	1
I like having a planned meeting with a group of people today for my class presentation in college.	1
I can't stand how much of a failure I am, and how mediocre I am. I'm the ugly friend and women ignore me. Online dating is a joke. I hate my body with a burning passion. I'm bad at everything I do. Every attempt to feel positive is met with a "no! you can't feel like this, and here's why". It's like my brain is set to the "negative" setting by default, and I can't change it. Then I just give up and let myself succumb to the self-hate.	1
Any tips for how you guys who have made a similar move made some friends?How to function properly when you realize there's no such thing as life? I'm depressed but I have no sad story to tell (just an uneventful one). I fail at everything and turn everyone down mostly because I was tormented for years by the absurdity of it all. I don't care if me dying will affect anyone. Someone's "recovery from depression" doesn't concern me neither. We're just complex preprogrammed machines creating illusions to survive and reproduce, to seek pleasure according to the program. We're part of the universe and shit, cool, so what? It's not even about the pain anymore. Why keep going when life doesn't exist? But if I do stay for a while, how do I even function properly when I'm stuck with this in mind?Has anyone tried ketamine-infusions for depression? I'm desperate for something other than another magic pill, so has anyone tried ketamine-infusions for depression? How'd it go? How'd you pay for it? Please and thanks What to do with my life. I just turned 21 in June and I’m really understanding that life is moving at a very fast pace. I was never good in school only because I hated it and never realized how bad it would effect my future the way it is now. I moved away for college at 19 for a whole year and only passed a few classes because I didn’t care that much. I came home and decided to take the year off. In that year off I didn’t grow as a person and I feel empty all I do is sleep and play video games and go out once every two months to hangout. My parents are complaining that I have no girl friend , no life and I’m anti social. I’m not anti social I just feel so empty and lost that I don’t feel like doing anything anymore. I don’t even know if I can go back to school because of my grades were and I was lucky enough to get into school. I don’t want to move out I just want to go to school and come home as quickly as I can no friends nothing. This lack of growth in the last year has made me thinking to the point. Do I kill myself? What’s the point of living if I don’t finish school and get a job, why live if I’m just gunna work min wage my whole life? Lately I’ve been asking myself this everyday. What do I do with my life? Is there really a point in living if I don’t become a engineer, doctor, lawyer, etc ? All my friends are doing great but I’m just at the bottom and I don’t understand why they would hangout with a loser like me that isn’t even at school In my early 20s and I’m living at home. I’ve already missed out of going away for university. I really feel like killing my self is the last option I have because if not I’ll be homeless because I don’t want to hurt my parents anymore with the embarrassment of a child I am and live at home. What do I do.Waking up I have nightmares every single night. Most people would feel better after realising they aren't real. My stomach sinks every time. Those torturing nightmares are ten times better than reality. Waking up is the worst.Advice or encouragement for first psychiatrist appointment? Today I booked an appointment to see a psychiatrist, and somehow they had an opening for tomorrow. I’m nervous and have no idea what to expect. I need help to understand it myself Dear people of r/depression, I need advice for motivation and mental calmness. I have had my share of depression in the past, but I have tried hard, so hard to make my life as happy as I could.	1
And know,	1
I've been known by my friends to be the jokester, the guy that makes people laugh.  What none of them know is that I do it because I'm trying hard to not to feel depressed, and I'll try to make a joke out of a lot of stuff.  Sarcasm is my friend.  It makes me feel good for a little while, but eventually the happy feeling from laughter returns to feeling like crap.  Inducing a natural coma This is a very serious question.Id like to induce a coma of at least 3 months on myself. People who are giving me the ‘not possible’ or ‘only medically induced’ answer. Tks but no tks.Anyone else feel like everyone hates them? Or is that paranoia? I feel like the dark cloud over my head just gives off a shitty vibe that makes people think I don't like them and vice Versa. I don’t want to be an adult anymore. I’ve been struggling with my depression a lot lately and I really really wish I could turn to one of my parents to tell them how much I’m struggling. More importantly, I wish I could tell one of them and one of them cared.	1
I don't want anything, just go to sleep and never wake up, but it won't happen to me...	1
I'm sorry.	1
Long story short, I don't know what to do. I feel so terrible to be annoyed with the situation, but I am. Why doesn't this person doesn't like me? I met this girl through my best friend and we were cool and cordial with each other. Months later, I said "hey" to her and she thinks I was being rude or mean to her but I wasn't at all. My friend tells me that she doesn't like anymore and wants to fight me (for no reason). I haven't saw her in months and I thought she would be passed the situation but apparently she's not. She wants to create fake drama between us and tell lies because she doesn't have a good reason to fight me or not be cool with me no more. She thinks i have an issue with her but she's the one who has it with me OVER NOTHING. Why is she doing all of this?How do I befriend my crush? So there's this girl (21/f) that I (21/f) really, really like. I live in a super homophobic country. I've accepted the fact that nothing can happen between us. However, she's just such, such an amazing person, that even if we weren't romantically involved, I would want her in my life, as a friend, because she's just so great - no joke. I'm not sure what her impression of me is. My crush and I actually have a ton of mutual acquaintances and friends. We've even worked together on an event before, but it was a large scale event with a large team, so I didn't really feel much. She once even smiled at me when she saw me!	0
I hope I die I can't handle this well I don't want to I'm so fucking pathetic I hope I die she does too so I should I'm sooooo tired I just want to die I don't think I can stand seeing her face in the halls every day again I just can'tI have severe anxiety and suicidal ideation I have no motivation to do anything. If i dont go to work im in bed all day. I have no desire to text friends or do things i used to be passionate about. All i can think about is how much of a loser i am because i haven't applied to any colleges yet (i graduated in may). I see on social media people going out and having fun and i look at myself, im never out of bed. The only time i shower is when i go to work or go run errands with my mom. I am physically and mentally exhausted. Another thing, I have severe anxiety about posting on social media. Ill muster the courage to post a selfie and then delete an hour later. When i have panic attacks i delete my profile picture, bio and everything i posted that is a picture of me or i think people will judge me for. I keep thinking that my friends are just talking about me behind my back and actually hate me. These thoughts get so overwhelming that i start picking at my skin where i think there's something "wrong" about it and pulling my hair out. I keep cutting my hair, too. Its only two inches and it used to be down to my elbow. I keep thinking it will be all over if i just walk outside onto the freeway or swallow some pills. The only thing stopping me is that i can't get out of bed most days. I cant handle being myself anymore and i dont know what to doHow do I know I'm depressed? I don't have persistent sadness but some days I just feel really really down. Today I thought about how I could kill myself on my commute, but I think those might have just been wandering thoughts and nothing serious. I think today I might just have a case of the Mondays?I will never be able to take care of myself, let alone anyone else. I physically can't find the energy to even do the most basic things, like laundry, showering, and eating. Grocery shopping is a really tiring adventure that is followed by a four hour nap. My schoolwork to rest ratio is 1:10. I can't even remember to water the singular plant that I own. They always end up dying before I even realize.	1
My sister cares and trys her best. She wants to buy a house and move down to Texas, that's where we used to live before pcsing to Washington state. I understand the position she was put in, we both had to endure the chaos that was our family these last few years, well since I was in the 8th grade really. However, her goals and mine don't align and I don't feel like compromising those for anyone else anymore.	0
After leaving yesterday, I hiked 4 miles to the top of an area mountain (really just a big hill, it's a foothills mountain) and had a conversation with myself as to whether or not I intended to jump.  I intentionally didn't take my gun with me because I never know.	1
someone offered to purchase my art today... Fucking amazing feeling, but at the same time I still feel like shit. Nothings ever good enough. Oh wellI am too much of a coward to even kill myself I am posting this here, not primarily to garner attention or sympathy, but because I have nowhere else to turn and I don't know what to do with myself. I also want to try and combat some of the embarrassment and shame that I feel in regards to being clinically address, so perhaps voicing what I am thinking here, it could potentially be therapeutic for me.	1
I've always wanted my mom's approval, I want it so badly, I want her to turn to me and say she is proud of me..but since I was a kid she always got my hopes up, she always left me to chase after her next boyfriend.	1
Learn to appreciate silence. Learn to appreciate a bit of loneliness and solitude. Self-love includes coming home from work to take a hot bath and drink a glass of red wine, not rushing over to whoevers house in order to feel loved by someone else.	1
I think my parents didn't want to have a child, but they made me anyway, so it won't be their fault that they didn't "continue". They made me a shy, helpless, depressed, anxious moron who's not able to achieve anything.	1
Today is the second day I'm missing classes. My first one starts in an hour and I live too far away to get there in time at this point. I couldn't get out of bed, and had the same problem yesterday. I just get this feeling of dread when I think about getting ready and actually leaving, and all I feel like I can do is lie in bed thinking about different ways I could kill myself (I'm not going to, it's just something I seem to always end up thinking about in bed, I know it's toxic but it's comforting).	1
He DOES NOT LISTEN!!! He thinks HE'S in control. If he were my child, I would've taken every possession he has (iPhone, Xbox, etc) and made him sit in his room all day being forced to read a book and learn to respect people older than him! He talks back to my mom A LOT, and the thing that makes me mad is we won't even do anything to him.	0
I barely graduated. As soon as school was over I quit adderall cold turkey, because it had been putting me in a very dangerous mental headspace for weeks, but until then it had remained a necessity. The withdrawals hit me like a truck. Getting out of bed felt like a truly herculean task. I was an empty husk of a human being and from graduation to camp in August I contributed almost nothing to the camp. I had nothing left to give.	1

Life is just shit, and I don't see why i should continueToday, I feel so horrible, it makes me want to die I made a fool of myself at work, felt so stupid after the meeting so I left work, told the boss I'm sick. Spent the remaining afternoon in bed. tired of being alone in this world with no accomplishments yeah thats the post Please someone be my friendI feel so down and disappointed sometimes I am 29 female and on verge of breaking down completely. I am facing a lot of rejections in life only because I don't look so beautiful in front of others eyes. I just don't believe that saying "Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder" . There is nothing like that. People just look at me like I am from some alien space. It just breaks my heart :( I don't care about anything. I have been really trying to figure how to stop feeling this way and I've seen a pattern which is just do something. Be create. Do something you like. Shit like that. I don't think people understand that I don't care about anything. I don't care. I don't like anything. I tolerate it. I don't like my favorite shows. I don't my old hobbies. I don't like the people I used to like. I don't like anything. I don't care about anything. I feel empty. Like all the things that made me who I am is gone. I don't care. How is "doing I like" helpful when I don't like anything? When I don't about anything I am doing? That is the reason I stopped doing first place. How is doing those things again going help me? This is like the biggest suggestion I have seen and I think pretty unhelpful. I can't just make myself care. I've tried. I wish I could care about those things again but I can't so suggesting to do those things, as if I wanted to stop, is like a punch to the face. "Oh your depressed? Just do what you like." No. I don't want to. I don't want things I loved and feel nothing. It hurts to want to enjoy life and can't. To want to care and you just can't. I've tried medication and therapy. I've tried giving so many fucks and I can't. I can't even fake it anymore. I wish I could. How do I care again? Do I just wait? I don't think much longer. No matter how much progress I make, I always fall right back down to rock bottom. All my friends have forgotten about me, and no one supports my art (writing and music). I can't find bandmates and all I can see myself doing in the future is music, but my talent is mediocre at best. I don't know what else to do with my future and I only see dark days ahead. I fell in love with an exchange student, who's now my boyfriend, but now he's back in his home country and I don't have the money to visit him... and he has strict parents who will only pay for him to visit me once a year.	1
I'm not letting my depression best me today. Rant To my manager. Eat a dick. If u think I really care about this minimum wage fuck ass job then you're outta your mind. Scold me all u want to. Fire me of u want. Won't matter in the long run anyway.I don't eat because I don't want to eat alone I live at a school where the only place to eat is a cafeteria. I stopped going because I'm always by myself. I already payed for the food and I don't have money to eat outside the caf so I just don't eat. God I feel like shit. I'm sorry for the life I chose, I just want another chance I regret every decision I've made in my life, like to list the off not in order of reason or value to me but just randomly. I have really bad teeth because I just drunk alot of fizzy drinks and didn't take care of them. Secondly this was because of that but I because shy and anxious all the time thinking about what people thought of me. So didn't make many friends in school. Then during school my attention gravitated towards video games and my grades became shit. Therefore felt like university wasn't an option for me. I was taking to this girl I liked and she didn't seem to bothered about my appearance more my personality but she was interested in someone else. I got really attached to her and ended up losing her and a good friend because I became too attached. I regret all of this 10 times over if I could relive my live I would regardless of the emotional scares and events that I went throughI guess my last submission got deleted Just wanted someone to talk toI’m 2-3 years I’ll be moving to a state where purchasing a gun is easy. I’ll finally be able to successfully commit suicide. Been through 11 electroconvulsive therapy procedures (shock therapy), so many medications didn’t work, my psychiatrist and therapist gave up on me. I’m exactly what you think I am, a fucking loser. A kissless, hugless, ugly, worthless virgin. It’s said that the decision of suicide is an impulse, well what if I told you this “impulse decision” has been 7 years in the making. I’m 20 now and man, it’s time to take action. Beautifully Broken I’ve spent most of my life afraid to be my true self because I believed that if I didn’t live up to the standards and norms that I grew up with, I wouldn’t be accepted. I was told since a young age how I should act, talk, and dress. I was told that money was important and that attending societal events and bullshit balls was your key to social success. And those things, trying to “feel” important, had meant everything to me.	1
During this time, things started to fall apart with me and my then-girlfriend as well. I kind of hid out with her for a while, because my family was perpetually sad and in a state of distress. And since I worked nights, I was kind of isolated. Things started to hit a rut between me and her when she started her own treatment for depression. I tried to be supportive of her, while doing whatever anyone in my family needed while my uncle was sick. She really seemed happy that I was there for her, (and things really worked out since she lived so close to my uncle anyways, and I could bounce back and forth from place to place on my days off.)	1
I started playing a game called Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice tonight and the their is a theme around psychosis, and the main character has many voices in her head. Here is the opening, (possible trigger warning?), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rob7C1lCYEI	1
I never thought the potential for another treatment would actually make me more suicidal, but here we are. Thanks for reading.I'm only 16, and I don't have the energy nor the motivation to do anything, and I'm constantly sad. Everything seems bland and pointless, I feel sad constantly, and the things I used to enjoy such as video games, and it's slowly growing old. I've been thinking a lot about the fact that I'm alone and never had any sort of relationship with girls for the past 16 years of my life, and it's really bringing me down. 17 soon, hopefully things will get better with time.How can I Kill the negativity inside my head? As I'm on my self improvement journey, even though I'm making progress, I hear a voice in my head telling me horrible thoughts. It's lowkey making me depressed.	1
I play soccer (football), and thats all I know, I’ve played my whole life. I don’t have much friends nor other hobbies besides gaming (very mediocre gamer). However, these pass two years have been terrible. Due to my undying love for the sport, I would try to play through the pain. (regret it) Which has only made me worse. I decided my first Summer with back pain that I would not play for a month. Which I achieved with no real results. I passed the time playing Video games. However, the constant sitting probably made my back worse. I played a tournament that same Summer after the month break. 5 games some sort of international tournament. By the end of the tournament my back had gotten so bad I couldn’t bear to move. Despite all this, I somehow got chosen to go to Spain. Few months later I went to Spain at 16, with back pain, played soccer and such but didn’t get noticed. Fast forward to now and I’ve gone a whole season barley playing and still struggle with back pain. Now I’m 17, I’ve gone this whole Summer without much activity just stretching and ab work outs.	1
Sorry, I dont have too many, Im mostly looking for movies to watch, maybe you have some to recommendAnyone else get more depressed than usual on your birthday? Today is my birthday and I hate it. For the last 5 years or so I've been especially depressed on my birthday. Guess it just reminds me that I was born.	1
Would I do it?	1
Oh yeah. Because all the empathetic people are depressed.How to break up with my depressed/suicidal girlfriend? I’m in a tough position... I fell for a girl over 6 months ago and we’ve been dating since. It’s faded for me at least, and I don’t feel the same way I did at all, but from what she’s told me her feelings for me have only gotten stronger and we’ve already hit the “I love you” stage. I still care for her as a person and there’s nothing bad between us nor do we argue, but it’s just not what it was and I feel like I’ve needed to move on for the past 2-3 months. My issue with this is the fact that she’s both depressed and has been suicidal in the past (not things I knew off the bat, but learned towards the beginning). She has 1 real friend and a sibling she’s close to, but aside from that she doesn’t get along with her family. She’s told me before I’m really all she has, but not in a desperate way (although I think it is that too). I don’t really know how to tell her or what to be cautious of because this is the first time I’ve dated someone like this. I know it’s a shitty situation but I need to move on in a way that leaves her the least impacted or in the best way I can. I haven’t done anything like cheat on her or hurt her emotionally but I know this will crush her either way...Doctor taking me off meds Cold Turkey Hi everyone, I've been on Prozac (Fluexetine) since 9th grade. I am a 2nd year student in college now. For the past few years I've been upped from 10mg, to 20mg, and now 40mg. I've been on 40 mg for 3 years. When I went to my doctor it was only to tell him during a check up that I was comfortable with my medicine and dosage, so he would send more prescriptions to my pharmacy.	1
There's no way to patch up, I'm broken glass I'm far from healing	1
It's been 4 years since Cindy and I'm not over it. It still kills me about what happened. I'm still depressed and suicidal. I honestly wish I did kill myself when I had the courage to do so. There hasn't been much for me other than pain. I haven't moved on and I haven't gotten over everything. This was my deepest darkest moment in my life so far. I wish I could say things got better for me since all of that but true is they haven't. I'm still the same lonely person I've always felt I've been for the longest time. I've tried dating in college and I've never had feelings for anyone. Don't have many friends and don't have any real reasons to be here still. I'm just waiting on that one thing to break me down to give me courage.	1
I guess you could say that I'm not doing too great. My plans for valentines day: 1. Lay in my bed. 2. Feel lonely. 3. Try to cry. 4. Realize I will never cry again. 5. Hate myself. 6. Debate if I should tell someone how shit I feel. 7. Lay there for the rest of the day.I don’t know what I’m doing anymore I feel empty, I feel bored, I feel depressed and I just want to sleep but even the thought of sleeping while there’s so much going on outside this house makes me anxious. Tomorrow I have another test and I’m skipping school again. I already skipped today because I was too lazy to start studying before Sunday and of course I didn’t know shit, so instead of taking responsibility I just skipped school. And I’m skipping again tomorrow because I studied even less for this test. My grandpa, the father of my mother, is risking death in an hospital bed. My mother is with him in the hospital everyday and every night to keep him company in his last moments of his life and she cries everyday. It hurts me so see her suffering so much. And it hurts me to see my grandpa in such critical conditions. I feel like they’re both miserable but I don’t know how to help. I wanna hang out with my friends to get rid of all these bad thoughts but I don’t have many, and if I ask them right now they’ll just answer “sorry, we can’t hang out, we have to study”. Which is true, I know it is because I should study, too. But I don’t. I just spend my days staying at home, listening to music and crying because I’m a pathetic piece of shit. I hate my life. There’s so much monotony in everything. I wanna try new things. I wanna make new friends. I wanna visit new places. I wanna become a new person. But I don’t know how to do it.	1
I’ve loved and lost many times and I know it gets better eventually, but currently it gets very very dark in my mind and I’m not sure what I can do to survive in the meantime. I’m in a very bad place and feel very anhedonic and suicidal thoughts are back (having been accumulated from all these problems). He was the one person that made me feel like someone understood and was there in this big bad world, and without him I feel like I’m floating and nothing will make me feel okay again for a long time. Fuck me When you’re such a piece of shit a guy has to look at other girls and lie to you, while lying right next to you.	1
Recently I've felt like nothing matters in the end, and nothing I do makes a difference. We're on a random rock floating through space in a universe thats bigger than we could ever fathom and we don't understand, and we think that things that we do matter.	1
Continue doing your research. Continue taking time for yourself. Continue setting your phone down for hours at a time. Continue living your life out and letting others play a part and not the center role. You’re the star of your life, you lead the show. Your family, friends, boyfriend, colleagues - they play their roles in your story. Most importantly, they play their lead role in their own stories and similarly you are character.	1

I don't know why I'm posting this, I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I don't know anything at all. And most of you are just going to look over this and leave. But if you care, will you talk to me? I don’t think people love me. They love versions of me I have spun for them, versions of me they have construed in their minds. The easy versions of me, the easy parts of me to love. But no one will ever love meA bad relationship and my current state of mind I'm 21 and i'm going to share some of my experience.	1
Customers are easier to deal with, but just a drag to have to deal with. It can be monotonous. Often, it’s annoying. But all the while, I just feel drained.	1
I've been through so many medications, doctors, checked myself into a hospital 3 times when I was sure I was going to do kill myself, called the suicide hotline several times, talked with friends, made lifestyle changes and all that. It still didn't work. I've only gotten more depressed.	1
I was so, so unbelievably happy.	1
You can't just replace somebody special with another person, and that you were. Special.	1
Why would you hang out with your friends when they are tired of your negative attitude? Faking a positive attitude is worse. If you're going to be yourself just stay home.	1
TL:DR - trying to take the easy way out has just made everything harder.All I do is work and sleep and stare at the wall Unsure about itFeeling numb I’ve realized that if I can’t talk to someone about my feelings then the next best thing is to write them down and seek advice from reddit so here I am. I’m on campus right now preparing for my midterm and my confidence is at an all time low. I haven’t even seen the paper and already I feel as if I’ve lost. I never thought I would reach such a low in my life. Something weird happened today. I finally set up a countdown timer to the day my exam results are announced. That seemed like the next logical step and it made complete sense to me in a weird way. The only thing that made me remove that was talking to my parents and seeing the hope and love for me in their eyes. I know my life isn’t truly mine and that if I hurt myself then I also hurt other people but it’s just getting too much. The thought is always there in my mind and for the past few days that voice has gotten stronger. I’ve been through this period before and had come out nearly unharmed and at the beginning of the year I was feeling optimistic about what’s to come but that lasted all of one month. The future I was dreaming of looks bleak and distant and with every passing minute that future keeps on going farther and farther away from me. I try very hard to keep my guard up near people I know and love but it’s becoming harder and harder to do so. I used to think that I was destined to do some good in the world but maybe that was just me being delusional. It’s getting harder to keep the tears in. Whenever I used to feel numb, I used to punch the wall just to feel something but even that is not helping now. All I wanna do is talk to someone and pour my heart out but I don’t know if I have the strength left to do that. Getting out of bed is starting to feel like a struggle and for the first time in a while I’m afraid of myself, of what I might do if things don’t go my way. I know that this is not the end of the line but why does it feel like it is? How can anyone recover from such a failure? It’s gotten so bad that I would much rather prefer that I disappeared than having to tell my parents what’s wrong. Depression is nothing new for my university and it wouldn’t be the first time that someone took a drastic step and now I know why they did what they did. The pressure and stress which comes with a university as respected as mine, is just too much to handle. I’m almost inclined to reveal my university’s name just in case someone’s able to figure out who I am and I can finally get the respite I desire so much. All around me I see happy faces and I can only hope that one day I can leave all this behind me and be happy but in the meantime I guess I just have to struggle on and wait for the light at the end of the tunnel. I am lonly Is someone there to talk?Trying to understand my depressed SO I'm sorry if I'm posting in the wrong sub. I just figured you guys could offer perspective	1
But this also affects your drive to treat your depression. When you skin your knee, you just take care of it right away, you don't give any second thought to it. It's just what you do. With depression, you know that you should be exercising, eating healthy, listening to happy music, cleaning, etc. But you don't. What's the point?	1
Now I'm at a new command. Ones that's actually very strict and now with problems like this there's actually bad repercussions for depression and shit so I asked someone I knew from my last command on what to do and he got a hold of someone here and shit blew up. I had chaplins calling me and a bunch of higher ups and I denied the chaplins talk because of my problems with the last one and I just went with a first class instead. Once again all they told me was how great the navy is and how my problems are just me being a pussy pretty much. Why doesn't any care about how we feel or how I feel. My last command we had a person who shot them self and they just swept it under the rug and acted like it never happened. Who can I actually talk to here that can help. All i want is to get out of the shit and be fucking normal again. I'm not good at anything I used to draw good but now i've gotten worse at it for some reason. I have no idea how life works, i suck at socializing and keeping up relationships. Even if i invest 300 hours in a game i am still below average at it.	1
I don’t know how to fully support him through this.  When he freaks out and wants to call the ambulance I don’t know if I should let him knowing that they’re just gonna say he’s fine or tell him that it’s in his head and make him feel like I’m not taking him seriously.	1
The downside - when I was in the deepest state of depression I was really close to killing myself and I also threatened to shoot up the school, after which police took me to a mental hospital. I've been here for over 3 months now. I did some really bad things, I acted really bad, but on the inside I felt better. When I'm anxious I don't do mean things to people, but on the inside I'm dying, I feel vulnerable and just want help.	1
I thought year 1 was bad, but then i met year 3 (different school). I got bullied even more in this class, they called me names, ignored me, humiliated me in class and started bitching if they had to sit next to me. Luckily they never got fysical with me (idk if thats the right word). In the middle of that year I decided in the middle of the fucking winter (it was snowing) in morning to take the bus (mom was always home and it was near our house) and to step of early. Spent 2 hours in a small freezing cold chapel playing on my nintendo 3ds, go to my house after mom left and spend playing games in my room. After 3 days the school called, my mom found out. I was stuck and told her everything about the bullying, about me feeling like absolute shit and that i had no motivation to go to school. She let the teachers know, went to school, got me to a psychiatrist. The bullying stopped, but they still ignored me, i still hadnt any friends and i still didnt feel any better. I somehow survived the 4 next months and passed. If i had 1.1% lower in total i would have failed that year. The only way i felt better was with playing runescape.	1
I have no friends This isn’t an over dramatic statement. I truly have no friends.	1
I ask her to give me time, as a roommate, as a past lover, give me time to heal before you see someone. Please, just give me some time to heal.	1

I'm trying to survive day by day through this hell on Earth. Each time those memories of my childhood flashbacks, I can't help stopping the tears that drop from my eyes. Whenever someone mentions France, I get overwhelmed.	1
TL,DR: Can't gather motivation to do anything, i need to do it, want to do it, but simply can't start doing it. Keep switching between doing other things instead. Anyone has any similar experience? This planet is making my depression worse It bothers me how unfair life is. How some people get 'lucky' and are born into decent families, live in rich countries, have good genes, etc. while others get fucked and are born into abuse, illness and poverty. I'm sure some of you know that picture of the starving child and the vulture by Kevin Carter - seeing something like that makes me feel so much worse. Maybe some of you know the stories of people like Junko Furuta or Sylvia Likens - knowing that things like these happen all the time makes me fucking miserable. It just isn't fair and it really makes me want to sign off. How can you be happy in such a world?Can’t fix anything in my life I’m such a fundamentally broken person. I’ve want to say I’ve been fighting for years, but that’a not true. All I can do is fucking run away from everything until the day is over. No action I take to improve myself can ever have weight because I’m so godddamn broken that when I try to do something to better myself, it just reminds me of how much of a fucking loser I am. I cannot handle the fucking *pain* that comes with self improvement. It’s not fun in the least. It’s humbling. Too humbling. And it just shoves in my face all the time I’ve wasted and all of the experiences I never had simply by virtue of being my self.	1
It's been three years since we decided to go our separate ways. We both had different goals, desires and aspirations. We were perfect together, but just at the wrong time.	1
Stranger: hmmmmm	1
I've always been academic and studious- if anything, I've dedicated my existence to the pursuit of knowledge, at the expense of forming human relationships. But I'm constantly overwhelmed by how much I don't know, how slow I am to understand concepts, and how my peers are all more intelligent than me. I know it's impossible to always be the smartest person in the room, but I feel that the fruits of my studies are disproportionate to my efforts.	1
It's embarrassing having to explain it all the time. Being an adult fucking blows, working a shit job that keeps me poor making me want to just jump in front of a bus Seriously struggling to see why I would want to engage in living when it's so menial and relatively pointless.	1
I don't know what to do. Life won't stop, and I'm so stressed that my whole body is breaking out in rashes and I'm sore all the time. I don't have any time off work since I haven't been there long and we're already short staffed. The end of the semester is coming up and I can't even think much less write a policy analysis.	1
I’m scared of the same thing for my dad. He’s still in a very good shape but i’m his only child.	0

My faith life has been doing pretty good recently too, especially compared to the past, but I still feel like a shitty person a lot.	1
Got the news I was 100% cancer free (again) last week, but I feel more emptier and lonelier than ever before. I'm not sure what's wrong with me, I know I have a great support system and I should be happy that I'm far away from the crutches of painful chemo and surgeries, but I just can't fill the void inside. I feel incredibly lonely and miserable, I barely can rack about 3 hours of sleep a night and at school I feel like an idiot because I can barely focus on anything.	1
Moreover, I watched a video of suicide survivors. About those 7% who survived suicide, claimed that in their final moments, when they were throwing themselves from a high place, they said they'd regret everything and wanted to live. Now imagine all those who died and regretted in the last moments.	1
Thanks everyone.  We're disgusted that this person is exploiting our community this way.	1
Tho, i know my best friend would never leave me since she wanted me up here anyway, but the jelousy that she is having such a good time with others are ripping my life apart.	1
I just dont know what t od o	1
I liked the study i was doing, so i decided to try it again but in a lower degree, its in a school for adults (18+). Its hard to explain but basically i ended up with 60% out of 20 people to be 30+ and have kids. It was class 1x a week and internship (idk if thats the right word) 2.5 days per week. I was working with adults who had a mental disability. Last year i never had internship, only class. It turns out that Orthopedagogie is not the study for me. I dont want to do this the rest of my life. I had officially quit november 2017.	1
I'm not in the position to get therapy. I know the issues, not much more than others out there. I've always just kept busy and got on with things. But this dread is getting much worse.	1
God fucking damnit.	1
I’ve tried everything - exercise, diet, meditation, meds. Nothing is working. Exercise just makes me tired. I’ve never gotten that rush of endorphins. I don’t have any hobbies that make me happy or that I can even focus on long enough to distract me. Every day is a huge ordealAnyone else feel the main cause of their depression is lack of confidence? I guess it could go the other way around tooI wanna die everyone hates me I wanna die everyone hates meStop and think for a moment It's like stumbling around in the darkness. You can't see, you can only feel. Blinded by the pain of reality.	1
I just couldn't deal with it anymore. Loving her is one of the reasons I am as miserable as I am right now and as stupid as it sounds, one of the reasons I think about suicide daily just because I can't get her out of my head.	1
I did start seeing a psychiatrist, and he is a kind man. He diagnosed me with depression and anxiety. He has never suggested that my depression is the cause of my physical problems, and he seems to be sympathetic to me as a chronic pain patient. He’s given me depression medication, but I don’t know how much it’s helping. Chronic illness is a thing that happens to people and it’s just *depressing*. I’ve always had depression, but this just makes it worse. He has never dismissed me for feeling that way or written off my pain as being in my head.	1
Fuck lifeno motivation, no drive I am l o s t I have looked into everything. Tried antidepressants. Looked into having ADHD. Got my thyroid and vitamin levels checked. Nothing is wrong... but I have no drive or motivation. I sleep like 10-12 hours a day. I can't bring myself to study or do work or care about anything. The occasional anxiety gives me energy, but the energy goes to contemplating suicide and wishing to opt put of life. I don't know what to do. Deleted my Facebook About a week ago I decided it was finally time to cut the cord with social media.  Something odd has happened since; my depressive episodes have been ALOT better and I’m actually being more social in school without trying to.	1
I don't know what's going on but I don't like feeling like that. If I'm hanging out with friends or family I'm usually fine, it's being alone with myself and having time alone where I can't entertain myself and waste away. I can't really explain it. Does anyone else feel like this? What helps you? I've never talked to a therapist or anything like that and understand you cannot give a diagnosis on here, but if you know any methods to help me get out of that feeling, I'd be eternally grateful. Is this what depression feels like and I've just been in denial about having it for years?Why does depression do this It's destroyed my ability to properly feel love or empathy with those closest to me.	1
This letter may be fragmented.	1
Bye.Everything has changed... About four years ago I was the typical loner. I was in the middle school. Nobody took me seriously, because my hobbies were not shared by anyone else. I'm from a small town, so it was difficult for me to find someone who actually liked the things I did. At the time I liked things like anime, video games and MLP. I am a 19 year old lass now and I only like video games now.	1
I wouldWhen people ask you what you did for the weekend, or for your birthday, etc. I have no idea how to respond. My emotions have become so numb  that I can't feel anything so therefore I cannot enjoy anything I used to like doing. I literally just go to work everyday for 8 hours, come home and browse the news and reddit and listen to music, trying to entertain myself but never really succeeding. There's nothing I can enjoy. So when someone asks me what I did I just say some crap like I just relaxed at home or something, I don't know what else to say.	1
That siren’s song has been stronger these past few weeks. Tonite ended with me locked in the bathroom, sitting on the floor in a fat, disgusting, pathetic crying heap - razor blade in hand. One of my cats scratching at the door &amp; me trying to hush her so as not to wake my SO. Through the tears I pathetically sliced away at my inner leg a few times. Been a decade since I’ve cut. No relief.	1

Back in september, uni started. We shared the same classes. We saw each other again and I thought it was a good opportunity to talk to her again and explain some things out, and especially apologize to her (we had a bad argument when I told her I was ending the friendship), and she apologized too. She was really excited because some of her guy friends were with her at uni and she wanted me to hang out with them. I was still questioning a lot of things about myself at this point, and I was terribly anxious about starting uni, and also because I was scared her friends wouldn't like me or think I'm too "innocent" or whatever. So I chickened out and decided to avoid her. Two days later, I dropped out of uni (not because of her), and didn't say a word. I was feeling ashamed about dropping out and I had issues at home that made me feel really depressed, so I isolated myself BAD. I pushed all of my friends away, and eventually ended up alone, well, I still had some internet friends, but they didn't last long because I ended up ignoring everyone's messages.	0
The two directors of the camp were both new my senior year. While I was in France, one of them dropped out of school due to her own struggles with mental health. The director that was left over was completely overwhelmed, and entirely ineffectual. People left and right were telling me that I should take the open position. I didn't want it; I have ADHD as well as depression and I was so anxious about my lack of organization. Camp was in such a hole though, and for the sake of my friends and my campers and their families I did the only thing I felt like I could do, and took on the directorship.	1
Working at a shit paying job with zero prospects and massive student debt, how can I possibly look forward to anything in the future when the present is always painful.	1
First and foremost, I'm a minimalist. The urgency of "I need to save and buy a house", or "I need a secure career/future", etc.. is non-existent in my life. Everything I own could fit in a van, and there would still be space left. I'm not exaggerating. I've even contemplated living in one; build some insulation to the walls, lay out some flooring, and call it home. I'd be absolutely 100% comfortable.	1
Everyday is a struggle for me to stay at work. All I want to do is sleep. I have constant migraines (a chronic condition), and the pain paired with the grief is absolute hell. I started seeing a counselor about a month ago, and I like her but she can only do so much. I am on medication, and I have a good support system.	1
So there, there is my fucking rant.	1
Anyway, a handful of months back I had the smart idea to get drunk by myself. I don’t know what did it, I only drank a few shots, less than what I normally do, but whatever I guess it was destined. Next thing I know, I’m waking up all wrapped up in IVs with my mom next to me. I’m confused as all living hell. My mom just says “you drank the vodka,” looking more devastated than I have ever seen her, and then I cry myself to sleep.	1
Things started falling apart at home when I was 15 years old. So my remedy to broken family was to drink until I couldn’t feel. But despite my new fond love of alcohol and its pain killing effects, I kept my life together. I worked hard in school, I stayed active in my community, and I made sure people thought I was keeping it together. I couldn’t let everyone know that I was a fucking mess. But in this process, I slowly lost myself and started living two different lives. When the curtains were wide open, people saw a girl that was very studious, had many accomplishment’s, and always had a smile on her face. But as soon as the curtains closed and I was alone, my demons came out. And the more I hid, the more I lost myself.	1
Even tho when i play games, she keeps going to private worlds with friends, and whenever i as for an invite, she ignores it, even tho it pops up a big icon on her face.	1
The argument started because I was talking too loudly to his son while trying to correct his behaviour. I am 38 weeks pregnant, and lately have been easily annoyed and upset by the boy not listening to me. My husband called me a bunch of hurtful things because I tried to explain why I was so upset. Later on in the night he told me my mom and oldest sister were no longer allowed to visit me for the birth of our child. Then he spent several more hours talking about how they were "rot gut whores" and how he doesn't want them around HIS son all because 2 years ago my sister invited me to a christmas dinner she knew I wasnt going to show up for and didn't specifically include my husband in the invitation. Yet his mom is coming a few weeks after, and she had left him and his brother to fend for themselves in a trailer in the middle of a forest only showing up to bring them food when they called her and begged her for it. But because she "hasn't done anything to offend" me, he is totally ok with her showing up.	1
Am I really such a bad parent for saying no? Help!I dont feel safe at my family home I live with my parent. Recenfly I feel strange, one of my family member I think always see me when I am asleep. And my gut tells me it is not good at all. Help... I   can't trust anyone right now. And I always be the one who is wrong. I don't trust my in-laws with my daughter. I just don't. It's hard to explain. Maybe I'm paranoid. Maybe I'm old-fashioned.	0
It’s been over three years since that happened and although I still struggled with a lot after that, I’m now in a better place.	1
Go home, usually bus. Already tired. Immediately engage addictions, usually beer and weed. Start watching TV or playing games and rarely stop until bed time. I'll leave easy tasks like cleaning dishes, etc for weeks. Continual evasion of solving problems, instead opting to rely on substances to either forget or balance my feelings of sadness. Occasionally I have friends over, but many of them use substances as well or are in similar life situations so finding solace in these encounters is limited. Furthermore, they are my friends of many years and represent a kind of social stagnation.	1
When you’re alive, you feel so much. Yes, there’s happiness, excitement, surprise, love. But there’s also sadness, anger, hate, jealousy. Why would I chose to bare such things when death can provide none of these things? All the “good stuff” about living doesn’t weigh out the bad, in my head. A nothingness after death just seems like the better, more rational option. Am I wrong to think this?Getting over a girl Hello everyone, I’ve been subscribed to this sub for a while now but always been a lurker and never posted anything. I feel that this is the best place to get advice and help for what I’m going through right now...	1
I confessed that I couldn't really relate to those sorts of situations or how they've affected her, as she has more zeal for life than anyone I've ever met.	1
i'm sorryMe too. You want a friend. You want someone to be there with you when you’re weak, and someone to comfort you when you’re down. You wish you weren’t alone but you feel invisible. You’re trapped in your thoughts and nobody can reach you. You feel like you can’t do anything right, like you’re useless. Everybody has friends except for you. You’re a burden and nobody actually likes you, you just exist. You push people away because you feel like you don’t have anything to offer, so you’d rather just be left alone. You can’t wait to die because life is pointless. You don’t want to get up anymore because you’ve been knocked down too many times. You’re so tired and weak, and the weight is crushing you even more. Every day that passes is the same and you feel like you’re waiting for nothing. Life can’t get any better because it just sucks and you wish you didn't exist.No lodging for the sad Being depressed sucks. That's easy to grasp. Most people who aren't clinically depressed understand this. What they don't understand is that being depressed and honestly trying to get better is extremely difficult, and our ruggedly individualistic society doesn't give a single fuck about you. You need help? Fuck you.	1
My best friend is stationed overseas, and while I have a close group of friends I’ve known for years, literally all of them are doing something this fall that takes them elsewhere. When they are gone, I’m going to be all by myself.	1
Anyways, I don't expect from you guys to be my therapist or giving me some life-changing advices... I guess I post this to release some steam. So if you managed to read my post until the end, Thank you :) And I hope things will improve for me. I've always lived in Israel and only left for trips. The longest was 3-4 months, and I have never relocated my life to anywhere else. So maybe it is just a matter of time until I will start to feel more like home here. If you have anything to share from your experience, that would be lovely just to know that I am not the only one who is going through this adjustment period.	1
You: just not giving enough of a shit to keep going	1
I dont feel like going out, i dont feel like talking to people. Runescape was always my escape, but i simply do not have the motivation to even play runescape . On the outside i still act normal, i laugh and act like everything is fine so my parents wont worry. Whenever i have a job they fire me because "i work to slow". Once i worked in a storage for a store and had to get the order from customers. You have to use "common sense" all the time, and they said i didnt have that enough for this job. This happened 3x...	1
This is mostly just a flood of thoughts that are always in my head, but I just wanted to give my two cents to see if anyone relates to these thoughts/feelingsI can’t decided if I’ve been managing or avoiding my mind and feelings... How is everyone today? For the past two months, I haven’t had a depressive/anxiety episode even though the problems are in the back of my head everyday I wake up. It triggers my anxiety a little because I’m anticipating another one of my relapses. It’s been weeks since I’ve cried or have been stuck in bed (which is good compared to what I’m like usually). But I still don’t feel too inclined to reach out to other people or hang out with them. I don’t feel like dealing with people’s criticisms or judgements of me. I’m just not open to it still...other than that I just feel indifferent/‘Meh’. But is that a good thing? Or should I zip my lips and stop thinking about it :/ some perspective would be nice.Got rejected again today. I have had this massive crush on this girl for a while now and we been getting along really well. I was suprised to find out we had quite a bit in common and I felt so giddy every time I talked to her. I decided today I would suprise her with an early Valentine's Day gift and maybe she would like it. Nothing huge, I got her favorite snack and a brief note telling her how I felt. I don't know what I was expecting but she read it the note and walked away with the gift. She texted me a few minutes later she was nervous to reject me because she knew I was afraid and she would like to stay friends. I can't blame her for how she feels, it's her choice. Although, I feel utterly defeated. I have never been on a date or been kissed, or in any relationship with someone. I thought maybe this would be it, but I was wrong. On top of all the other shit going on in my life, I don't see a good reason to continue this fruitless struggle to survive. I wish my mother understands depression I go to school and work, and right now that's handful for me. I work on weekend as well and I get very exhausted.	1
Stranger: hmmm	1
When you're an adult and skin your knee, you know what to do. You know that you're supposed to clean it, and put a bandage on it. And that's exactly what you do; you don't make a fuss.	1
2) Take care of yourself. Eat good food, get some sleep, spend time with people you love.	1
I told her then that I didn't feel ready for a relationship, but she essentially stalked me all those (5) years ago.	1
That's the vicious cycle that depression uses to keep you down.	1
Should I find myself some hope?	1
Today is your birthday and your loss cuts to my soul. I can build mountains with my bare hands, But my fingertips are dynamite.	1
Soon after, she wouldn't talk to me at all, and she avoided me. All of her friends told me that I shouldn't have done that because it was a bad thing to do. I just wanted to tell her that I wanted some space from her, so I could no longer have feelings for her. Since then, all of her friends, have treated me with aggression and insults. I get dismissed every time I'm around her and all of her friends. This has launched me into another Depressive episode.	1
I went inside the house and asked my mom about the guests, she told me that she intentially lied to me because she wanted me to come over and knew that I wasn’t going to come over if there were guests there.	1
No question really. I just felt the need to say it and acknowledge that I’m done. With everything.	1
I don't want to move back to my mom's. To sit there away from everything I want to do. And now I gotta start over.	1
I have also noticed, maybe because of my nature or leadership style, that im the one people tend come to with problems. I make it known that im here for that purpose, and people take me up on it. So I guess now i want to make sure i can spot when someone needs more help than they may be openly asking for. I will be more vigilant in my assessments of the needs of those under my watch.	1
When my fiancé came to visit me for a month, my best friend/roommate was very difficult... it’s a harsh word to use but she has a lot of learning to do. I have been on my own since I was 16 in doing things myself (with the exception of paying my phone bill and buying a car). Taxes, jobs, appointments, etc., were all me. She needs some help getting there and she has done and amazing job to get there but... every opportunity I hand her to take one more step of becoming independent she rejects and shuts down completely. The whole month was very hard for my fiancé and I over how jealous and upset she got and it was too much. Currently she is back home for Christmas and I am alone and quite frankly I needed it. I just don’t know how to handle that situation. It was as if she was using her emotions against me and it was poisonous. It go so bad my fiancé and Igor an Airbnb our last two nights together so it could just be me and him.	1
And because I don't have friends here and I am married (so meeting with girls on tinder etc. is not an option) I don't have many reasons to leave the house and it is kinda sad. The only reasons I'm leaving my house is for yoga classes, work, and restaurants with my wife. Other than that I don't have any other reasons to leave the house... The weather is fucking horrible, and it is so cold it is painful to me being outside.	1
Sub for high functioning depression? Title. This sub is okay but I feel like it's a lot of teenagers starting to  learn how to cope with the disease or straight up despair posts. I'm looking for more discussion than venting.Do you get colds often? My immune system sucks, I basically get a cold monthly and sometimes bi-monthly. I feel it sneaking up on me now . I have my questions that these frequent colds are from my anxiety keeping me up and lack of sleep and stress. Does this affect anyone else?"You're so good looking, how can you be depressed?" This sounds like a humble brag, but it really grinds my gears being told this. The statement is ignorant and while it's meant as a compliment it actually makes you feel worse...College makes me feel even more like shit Seeing everyone and their friends socialising and laughing. And i'm just empty and alone. Can't even make friends even though i try sonetimes. I always feel like shit but this just makes me feel worse.  So I graduated but fucked up my exams so bad that my u ivesorty rescinded their offer of admission. I've thrown up 4 times in the past hour after reading their email. I want to die so bad I'm sitting in the bathroom floor. Why the fuck am I so dumb. I did perfectly fine in school but I decided to get depressed in the final year and fuck it all up.	1
I understand. I hate that I can’t be vulnerable anymore. I hate that the trust is gone, and the resentment grows. If anyone has advice or a similar story of lost trust, I’d just love to hear and talk about it, if only to gain some perspective.	1
3) he tries to get me to adapt to him by saying things like:	0
I’m trying to block out  but it’s so hard. I can’t see an end to this, nothing excites me that much anymore and the thought of getting a proper career job terrifies me. I just want this feeling to stop, I can’t take it anymoreSadness is the only thing getting me through my day I'm not really sure where to talk about this because the people in my life don't really understand. I feel like I messed up a lot of my life and the track it was going on. Now I'm just very disappointed and sad with myself. I've tried pills and therapy. However, this might sound weird, but my sadness is the only thing pulling me through the day and making it pass by quickly. I don't know how to explain it because most people associate sadness with something they instantly want gone. Anyone else feel this way?I just really need to vent... For a start, I understand everyone in life are at different levels and that depression and anxiety is different for everyone and I am in no way stating who has it worst or better. I’ve taken hours and hours of training in it and I’m not here to speak or preach about how to help.. In a rare occasion in my life I’m asking for help, guidance, I don’t know the correct word but maybe if I explain myself a bit it may help. This maybe long and I do apologize but I just need to say all of this SOMEWHERE...	1
I'm struggling with this because it's really hard to balance not overeating with not being irritable. I don't really know whats going on.Seeing doctor this week to talk about my depressive symptoms. Is it bad if I ask to be put on AD’s? I’ve had some symptoms of depression for awhile (no motivation, always tired, mood changes, sadness, etc.). I’ve been pretty reluctant to bring it up but finally decided I should see someone to try and break the cycle.	1
She of couse, hid the pregnancy , tried to abort EVEN WITH ME BEING BY HER SIDE, lied to me about birth control pills yea, but fuck it i was a man and i for sure wouldn't let my daughter be aborted , she then tried to give her for adoption and was all about "she will trouble us, our life" and i was about to kick her out from the house get my baby and that's it. My parents started to help me but the damage was made it already and it was about to get worst. She was my bride and guess what ? Yea, she cheat on me. I understand that sometimes i was a dick but man i was not up to be a cuck. I went crazy again, but i controled myself, i send her back to her state with 2 K of money from my own (she quited her job with 2 months of pregnancy ) . I was so god damned hurt. Cheat on me with my best friend cliché ? Wow. Then i started to think about it, he had a great body because he almost live in the gym because he didn't work and didn't have a family . But she doing that ? That hurt me a lot more than he doing it. And i was only 20 back there. She find another guy, and seems like I 'm now the aprisioned guy addicted to drugs (like her aunt had telled me ) you know ? I'm so fucking sad. I loved this girl so fucking much , i wish so fucking much to had a life with her, with her daughter, with my daughter. She left and didn't even ask about our daughter. You know how sad this is ? On the other hand, i'm so frustrated about womans and so sad that every girl that i start to like i dump her because i don't want to delay her life like KIm did to me. I'm fucking scared of relationships, i'm fucking scared of girls , i'm fucking terrified by the idea of trust anyone else then my father and my mother. i 'm not feeling like a man anymore, i'm feeling like shit. BUT i started to train again in Muay Thai and i'm enjoying it. but i feel so fucking lone because i really do everything alone. My workout, go eat some pizza, walk in a park.. i'm so alone.	1
I’d like to try being put on antidepressants and see if that helps me get back to feeling better about everyday life.No friends whatsoever. Living in isolation. Please help me I'm in my final semester of undergrad. I'm 24. I live in a university apartment. I have severe social anxiety. I've gone through therapy before, stopped for a while, and am now trying to find a new therapist that takes my insurance.	1
It’s time to wake up and see that the “stigma of mental illness” is just psychiatric propaganda to deflect all the damage and life’s runid by their tortuous domain and authoritarian political reign.	1
I feel if I don't get this out, even if it is never seen by anyone, I will implode. I'm on medication and it helped my depression but then the reality of my life struck me and I think I'm worse off than I was. At least then I was able to lose myself in video games. Now I'm here with the stark reality. I am not meant for this world. I am too sensitive, too weak, too weak-willed, and too much of a bitch to handle life. I'll go back to lurking now. Thanks for listening.The thing that sucks is that i have no one left to talk to No one's willing to talk to me and listen to my bullshit. And everyone that I've told ends up leaving me or call the cops or some shit. No friends either. Just keeping the suicidal and depressing thoughts to myself waiting for me to blow and kill myself one day. Maybe I look forward to that day 🤔I need to get my life on track Im 23 year old black man who just graduated from one of the best universities in the US. I've been depressed as fuck for a large portion of the last 4-6 years. I have no money, no girlfriend(or prospects), and no social life to speak of. I had a solid social life in college but had no luck with girls. Made a lot of friends but none that I'd consider great ones. I'm  afraid of public expression, if I come out of this shell I'll just be that little underdeveloped, short loser who thinks he's the shit when he's accomplished nothing in life. I'm afraid of what other people think of me, do they think I'm smart? Do they think I'm nerdy? Do they think I can't dance? Do they think I'm too short? Do they think I'm attractive? Do they think I'm gay? Do they think my voice is deep enough? Do they think I'm laid back? Do they think I'm fake? Do they think I'm a pussy? Do they think I get girls? Do they think my dick is small? Do they think I'm dressed well? Do they think I'm shy? Do they think I'm lame for a black guy? Do they think I act too white? Do they notice the awkwardness when I talk? Do they think I speak well? Do they think I ask too many questions? This causes me to lie to the people around me, including my family about little things that it's unnecessary to lie about. To put on this front of fake confidence when inside I feel like I'm not worth shit. I blow off my friends and then justify it to myself that I'm somehow too good for them. I don't pick up phone calls from family members and try to keep to myself. I just do nothing all day and wait for shit to come to me. I'm not the guy that gets girls, when it comes to trying to actually start a relationship with a girl my awkwardness and lameness just begins to show itself and she immediately senses it and can tell I'm not shit. I've had sex with 2 girls in my life and couldn't actually bust a nut for whatever reason. I'm an asshole to the people around me that do really nice things for me but somehow my brain keeps justifying my behavior and I keep doing it. I can't bring myself to do anything that is remotely productive or will help me better my life. I'm self aware to the point where I know I'm being a complete piece of shit but I can't find the motivation to turn it around. It's like my brain telling me I'll be content just living in my parents house until I'm fucking 60 years old. Somehow when I look in the mirror I see myself as an attractive man, I just look super young for 23, people say I look as young as 16 so I'm also self conscious about that which also makes me put on this facade when I'm around people. Recently for long stretches of months I just go completely ghost and don't leave the house or do anything of use. On the bright side I've had many positive experiences in life where I've felt my potential as a person start to become realized. I have a degree in communication studies from a top 15 university in the US. I have a family that loves and supports me (but probably wants me to move out just as much as I want to move out). This is all pretty incoherent and stream of consciousness but my brain is just really jumbled right now and I had to vent. I need to turn my fuckin life around.Long text, I just want an audience. Why haven’t I killed myself yet?	1
I am somewhat familiar with the omens regarding stopping an anti-depressant cold turkey and the associated rebound depression and serotonin-related issues, however, I am unsure why I haven't experienced anything. The optimistic side of me wants to explain this as my body just being weird and being able to withstand this drug-related anomaly. The pessimistic side of me believes that it's related to escitalopram somewhat length half-life and that a nightmarish hell awaits me very soon.	1
Wish that guilt/shame didn't effect me so much.  Much worse people are unhindered by it each day.I'm drowning I really can't breath. I'm drowning and can't see any chance of things getting better. I don't know how to open up to people. I don't know how to make things better. I've tried so many things to get myself out of this rut but I just can't. I really don't know what to do anymore I feel like i have lost all hope. I've been to a doctor before and got medication but I didn't want that to be the first solution. I guess I expected my doc to have the answer for me to get better. I didn't take the meds because the crazy side effects and again I only wanted to take them if I absolutely need them and the doc didn't even try anything else. So now I've hit a wall and I don't think it will get better. I want to die. Feeling a lot worse when alone? So I'm not sure if I'm depressed or not, maybe just too dependent on close ones. But does anyone else actually manage to feel somewhat okay around particular people, only to go back to feeling somewhat numb when alone? I'm not sure how to deal with this, but when I'm alone I'll do shit like binge eat just to feel something. Contrary to when I'm not alone, and can actually push myself to go and exercise. The snowball effect is real... but man do things feel like a struggle for no reason right now, even knowing that it can get better when socializing. Any advice?Life Is already hard and It's 100 times more hard for people who are lonely and depressed This Is how I feel, post your opinionsI’m tired I won’t kill myself but I really fucking want to. Can/Should I send her a dm? Hi	1
I like the fact that I have a place to resort to to write down the thoughts streaming from my mind.	1
So, i was with Kim about 2 years by now AND THEN SHE FINALLY GETS A JOB. we had moved on from my parents house a long time ago but i was not happy because Kim's past started to bother me.	1
Anyway~	1
1) I, the other TAs, and our professor will not be disappointed if you do not perform as well you want, so you shouldn't be either. Tests and grades are not always the best reflection of you as students/scientists, and they are most certainly are not a reflection of your worth as a person. All a test assesses is how much content you remember and how well you can take a test at a certain time on a certain day. It is simply one data point, and as you should all know by now, 1 data point is not representative of the population. For many of you, you have other finals/presentations/responsibilities going on, and it'll be difficult to find time to study. For others, you may want so badly to study a lot, but can't because you are so stressed and anxious. I personally deal with anxiety and depression, and I know how utterly frustrating it is when your mind doesn't work as well as you want it to.	1
She had me believe this was the start of my happy ever after, before ripping it away from me.	1
Minor story, I got a bop it toy for Christmas. She asked to borrow it and take it to school, she had to write her name on it so if it got lost, the school would know who it belonged too. She never gave it back, and about 2 weeks, her and mom were playing with it, I asked if I could have it back, and she said it was hers. I never saw it again.	0
Me: "I wrote a post on reddit and saw my school consellor once".	1
Stranger: too many options	1
About a month ago I signed up for secret santa on a whim. I had never done it before and honestly didn't expect anything. But yesterday, my gift arrived. I don't know who this person is, but they spent at least $150 dollars on about 6 separate gifts. They also included a really thoughtful and touching letter that talked about how they thought I was such a great person and how much they enjoyed learning about me.	1
I do not know whether to take this opportunity to improve myself and pursue my own hobbies and basically just do things on my own, or attempt to reconnect with my friends/actively seek out people who will appreciate me.	1
I broke down in my car today after seeing some old photos of my kids when they were babies.....	1
Sorry for all the "fucks".I don't need help or pills, I need to die. Nothing like that has or ever will help. No platitudes, nothing is ever going to help.  I'm stupid, useless, weird, and have no personality.  I'm a waste of space and I HAVE to die.  There's no other option.I got my first birthday present ever today from person outside of my family So I turned 21 yesterday and today I meet up with friend and he wished me happy birthday and gave my nice bottle of Prosecco. (I Love it) I never ever received gift from person outside of my family for birthday, so I was little shocked. :)  I think my life is slowly getting better. ;)Officially by myself. Texted my ex who is the only one who knows about my depression and suicidal thoughts, told her i fear i might not make it till next week. Since she is at this big end of the school year party she told me not to talk to her about this as she doesn't want her night ruined, and then literally told me to 'go see a psychologist'. Can't believe the only person i've ever trusted in enough to let her know about my condition just let go of me like that. Part of me wants to kill myself to go out with a big fuck you, the part of me that wants to keep going is slowly dying.I don't know how to go about this. Hey. Im Tomm. Ive had a fucking miserable time in the last 21 years. I havent been happy for the last 11 years and when i finally am happy and get into the swing of it, it fucks off and leaves me to suffer. Rant; for the last 10 years my dad has had cancer, hes not well at all. It seems im the only one who gives enough of a shit to help him. I wouldve moved away and had a life by now, but ive stayed purely for him. Last week i realised hes manipulating me to get anything he fucking wants. The girl ive been chasing for 6 months that i fell in love with has just fucked me off. Long story short about 3 months ago she had a 2 year anniversary with a guy but admitted she has a thing for me. So i waited it out and about 3 weeks ago they broke up so i thought 'hey, ill see if i can hang out with her and see what happens' nope. Told her i still feel how i did and she just says 'i see you as a friend and nothing more'. Maybe im just not cut out to be here, or to deal with people? Ive had a fucking terrible time, people to chat too would be nice. I don't feel well. Hey, I'm a highschool freshman and this has been the lowest I've ever been from the past three years of feeling like I should be gone. Buckle up your seatbelts because this'll probably be pretty long.	1
But this is past RIGHT ? right ? maybe i should just 'fuck off' and get back to my parents house but love is a sick joke. Let's advance some months (10), we had a baby. She is the reason that i'm here typing this now for you guys read it, because if not, it was for me being burned in hell for suicide.	1
I didn’t notice myself become so gradually withdrawn from everything. Now going to the shop or getting the bus is something I’d rather not do. Things I’d do every day. My social life went backwards as well as my social skills. Now I’m afraid to talk to people. I literally reject girls I’m interested in on the spot, before I even have chance to fuck it up myself. Things that I would do without thinking now take encouragement and energy.	1
However it just seems to be getting worse not better. I can barely go outside without going through severe anxiety attacks which leads to horrible pains in my stomach for which I need to go home to go toilet for, when it was really bad I would feel very faint and start having panic attacks. It reached the point where I was practically housebound. I spent like 3 months playing games, watching anime and TV shows and the pains started to get a bit better.	1
God it's such dirty bullshit.Why do I feel this? I've been suicidal and depressed for the longest time. At first I could Control it and lately it's taken over my life. It's all I think about and it's fucking hell. I've lost all emotion other than sadness and depression. I don't want to do this anymore. If this is what the rest of my life is gonna be like then I don't want to live. This is my lowest point in life. I'm so lonley and can't even keep my thoughts organized. It's a mess. Please help me. When someone shouts at me, I cry and can't stop it I am definitely deleting this thread later.	1
I've been to a few separate doctors and have been recommended medication, which I believe it has just made it worse. I've talk to my parents but they just talk highly of the pro's of medication and councillors. Hate councillors. (I always ended up lying to them)	1
I'm working as hard as I could but she still thinks it's not enough. She's one of those "the harder it hits the better it gets" person. She wouldn't understand that hitting hard could break things.	1
I appreciate you and all that you stand for. When you're feeling down, I want you to stop and try to appreciate others.  Appreciate those who walk the same path with you.	1
Anyone else got to hear stuff like this?I'm lost hahaha I don't even know why I posted this.  I broke up with my gf today.  I thought I was happy about it.  I think is the right choice.  A month of cutting and self hate is enough.  But now I still feel it...  And I want to cut again. Anxiety and Depression make you contradict and lose yourself I've had enough. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for months and the whole situation is fucking my mind up.	1
I didn't go in detail 'cause I don't think many people will be interested in my story. But if you are, I wouldn't mind sharing you the whole story, as long as you can share me yours.	1
These episodes are sort of like skinning your knee. When you were little, skinning your knee feels like the absolute worst thing in the world. You think, "OW, THIS HURTS SO MUCH! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?!"	1
One time, before I die, want to feel this. Die die die That's what i hear in my head everyday, i know i need to do it, i just wish i was brave enough to go through with itI met an amazing friend Life has been pretty tough the last few months. But I met a friend off of Reddit about a week ago and this has been one of the happiest weeks I’ve ever had. I’ve never felt so wanted and appreciated before.Anyone else just tired all the time? All I want to do is fucking sleep. I try to be normal, but when I'm alone, I can't wait to get back in bed. If I get to work early, I nap in my car. Everything is so exhausting.FUCK this has been a long month Seriously, how can 31 days feel like 31 weeks?	1
I should stop before I become some combination of "old man yells at cloud" and "whiny emo stereotype". This stuff sits on me every day and I wish the small part of me that wants the affirmation of others wasn't there. But it is, so here I am.I thought I'd share two quotes that I liked/felt I could relate to. I don't know why I feel like sharing them here, but maybe somebody can take something away from them. They're both from Emil Cioran and his work *The Trouble of Being Born*.	1
I'm going to get a team and everything.	1
I used [this](https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/) word cloud generator. Cheers.I attempted suicide and called my GF, who called the cops who then took me to the hospital. I kinda wish I had just died. We had just broken up and I got the urges to just end my life finally, I've felt like this for years upon years. I've lost so many people in my life recently due to deaths over the last few years, and this just brought me over the edge. I wish I could have ended my life so I don't have to wake up with so much pain everyday. My new kitten disapeared this night and i can't help feeling like trash. Last year I adopted a kitty to help me through my depression, we lived a year together. She ran away after I had to move back to my father's house back this april.	1
Edit: I'm not okay but I'm more safe now, thank you everyone.That feeling when you hate who you are as a person but can't get yourself to change because you are so used to being like this for the past several years. I've become a shitty person. The thought of change seems impossible to me at this point. Work I like to stay at work for long hours because it seems to be the only place where someone is glad to see me. I get to help my team members and we all laugh with each other. I almost hate to go home to someone reminding me of what I haven't done yet. At the same time, my coworkers don't really see me as a friend. I'm constantly on the outside of the conversations taking place. I'm often left behind during break and if a coworker shows or shares something with the other while I'm there,I will be ignored. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm cool enough to laugh and joke with but not cool enough for anything else. Anyone ever look back at their younger years and wonder how they used to be such a joyful person? I saw a post on here about someone remembering a feeling of emptiness since they were five and just not knowing it was depression.  For me it's the opposite.  I was always a super joyful kid, and maybe a little too hyper.  (I was that annoying kid when I was 10-11).  Then around seventh grade I started to withdrawal from the world slightly, and just talked a little less than average.  This seemed all fine at the time, it made me a more likable person.  But I think that was the beginning.  I finally realized my lack of a friend group because of how I acted when I was younger during third quarter that year.  It wasn't bad depression, but it only got worse from there.  My Dad turned from mean to abusive starting next year, and my mom started to be disappointed with everything I do.  My parents don't even know anything about me besides a few keywords because they haven't held a conversation with me since I was 11.  The only person who I can say genuinely cares for me is my best friend, and he doesn't even know I am depressed.  I don't see a reason why I am, so why should I explain that to someone who is much more depressed than I am?  By the time I turned 14 I can say I was depressed.  "Functionally depressed" I guess, using terminology from one of the top posts here.  I don't know what to do.  Need help with suicidal wife, please. My wife is at work right now and to give a tl;dr, she hasn't been well for a while. I told her months ago that I wasn't sure if I could still be in a relationship with her anymore. She really needed a therapist so I really encouraged her to go. I think she may have only gone in an effort to save our marriage rather than herself. She's gotten new meds and this has happened over about 6mo. Last night I found a long search history of methods of suicide and I found a suicide note post dated a month from now. She's giving enough time to prepare everything. I'm not sure what to do. I plan on having a sort of intervention with her friend, mom my and hers to pursuade her to go to the hospital voluntarily, which I don't think shell do. Idk what to do. Idk what to tell my kids or how to handle any of this. Call me Mrs. Self-Destruction Everything I do is wrong. I was given every advantage in life: intelligence, compassion, athleticism, even looks. I have spent the last 11 years (since 15) sabotaging my own success. I'm now  in full self-destruct mode.	1
In December time it reached the point where I would barely go to class because the idea of seeing people, going to class, and even just getting out of my bed just seemed overwhelmingly difficult to me. I would cry all the time, tug my hair and cut my forearms, and would call the suicide hotline. My teacher emailed me numerous times, all very inappropriately about how her parents were dying to and how I should turn to God (not that I don't think that that is a viable avenue for some people, it just seemed like weird advice from my teacher) I tried going on anti depressants (Escitalopram?) but they made me vomit after just one pill so I stopped straight away. I travelled with my long distance boyfriend who came to Japan to see me, and felt nothing. Then I went to Nagano with my host family, and felt some kind of peace, and calmness. This calmness and general mellowness resided in me for some time, until now.	1
I don't want to make her angry but I know just my presence in general will fuck	1
I'm not sure if I should have posted this in suicide or here as it has to do with both. Depression sucks, that's a fact we all know, but suicide is not the way to go. There is always another way, at least that is what I like to thinkLife can't be enjoyed and is all about stress and anxiety, why should I give a fuck? I have no friends irl and can't make any because i can't be social for shit, nor do i want to make any effort improving that. Family time is just plain meh and i don't really feel loved, even though i am. I find no enjoyment in anything.	1
One named frankie took a liking to me and was super affectionate. I ended up taking him home today. He meows a ton and im thinling of naming him meowskers (dont judge me)	1
I used to be severely depressed. But lately my life has been pretty good. But sometimes I get into a depressed mood and I start having doubts about my relationship.	1
EDIT: Formatting is hard okReddit Secret Santa Saved My Life... I want to begin this by saying that I've been in a really dark place recently. Combination of family issues, breakup, and finals put me in a really depressive state. As a result, I'd been having strong suicidal thoughts for weeks. I had been seriously thinking about ending my own life. So that's the context in which this occurs.	1
I used to be really sociable, but a multitude of issues have led me to slowly isolate myself from people. I still have friends, but they either don’t actually gaf or they have their own problems and I don’t want to add on to their burdens. It’s also very difficult for me to meet people without any alcohol or drugs to calm the anxiety—something I’m trying to stay away from as my addiction problems have led me to the psych ward. Besides, how much can friends be there for you? It’s you alone in your bed staring at the ceiling til noon the next day for days on end (I’ve had terrible insomnia since coming home).	1
Sorry for this mess... English is not my first language.Fuck you for being happy around me Goddamn it, I can't even think straight. I hate the people who make me happy because they choose not to. I'm completely alone, and the worst thimg was thinking for a day or two that wouldn't last forever.	1
Stranger: i mean thats more of a situation where suicide is more reasonable	1
Three years later, we live totally different lives than back then. I got that job. I traveled the world. I went to Italy - twice. I've been to Times Square at midnight, and so have you. I did it all, but by myself. It's not what I wanted. It's not what I envisioned.	1
I cracked my bubbly back, as a soreness hit my veins. I stood slowly, my body tossing and turning inside. The world turned askew, as the sun beat slowly onto my flustered body. I took flight across the ramp of a broken dream, taking a flip that would ruin me for a day. A nostalgia for the life that was simple broke me down slowly, as I felt my walking slow down. I sat by a curb, watching a teenager go away from a regretful sunset on a bench. He sported a terrible frown, forgetting of the one. A light flew by at fast speeds, turning away from my stretched out legs, as a noise emitted from it’s front.	1
(I’m sorry for the rambling and any punctuation/grammar errors). Just wanted to share Hey, first time posting here. Just wanted to talk to someone there since is not really any option irl.	1
I know she values our friendship and cares about me. She’s just quiet. And I’m insecure about that. I just don’t know how to live with the lack of conversation because I feel like there’s a lack of friendship in our quiet apartment.	0
A handful of months later, after my parents had taken away my phone and forced me to be supervised by them every night, I was accepted into a local university. I had also found a new therapist and psychiatrist. Their words stuck to me: 1) "Depression sucks and it most likely will be with you forever but there are ways of treating it." and 2) "You get to a point in your recovery where you can't blame your depression anymore. You just have to stand up and do your homework/go to your job/go to class." I was also lucky enough to have a couple professors that understood on a basic level what I was going through. One told me to show up to class no matter how miserable I was. I didn't bother to explain that depression wasn't about being miserable, but from there on out I did everything within my emotional power to go to class, even if I had drank before (that happened a couple times) or didn't participate (happened almost every time). I ended up getting a C or D in the class, but I take that as a win since I easily could have failed. Another professor asked student services to reach out to me after I hadn't shown up to class a couple weeks in a row. I learned there will be a lot of people that don't get it and don't want to get it, but the one or two that do make all the difference in the world.	1
Now I just sit alone in the dark writing you letters that I know you’ll never fuckin’ read, pretending in my head that there’s some fucking way that i can salvage the situation. It’s like watching someone stand at the bottom of the pool drowning, when all they have to do is swim to the surface.	1

I don't know what to do. I really wish there were an easy way to say "I don't like you anymore, so please don't be hurt that I don't reach out, but god you don't know how much I care about you."Lifelong friend keeps lashing out So I have this friend, she's my best friend and have been forever. ?We've been friends since we were 2, we traveled the world together. We're now 25. She's been through a lot, difficult family stuff, life isn't easy on her at all and her entire life is struggling. Honestly, she needs me. Without me she'd be pretty lost and she knows it. I pretty much take the mothers role. Her mother isn't there (and usually she's more destructive than anything) and I do a lot of the stuff mothers do, including being her punching bag. Because of all of this, she tends to be very impulsive and when she's upset she can say stuff that are very hard for me, like she can get upset with me and then say mean stuff, and that she wants me and everyone else to f-ck of and leave her alone, sometimes worse. It doesn't sound too bad but when it happens repeatedly from a good friend when you try to help her it's really really hard. Every time I have to tell her that it hurts me, I have to practically beg her to say sorry. Eventually she breaks down and says she's so sorry and that she can't control herself. I always forgive. The thing is I know she doesn't mean it. And also I know she's naturally impulsive. But also I don't think she's really trying to control it. I know she's got so much on her plate that it's natural to lose control and not be able to always control everything, but it's really hard for me even though I know she doesn't mean it. Right now I honestly don't feel like I want to talk to her. I think the fact I ALWAYS forgive makes her not really try to control it. She lost dozens of friends because of it but she know I will always stay. Right now I just feel like telling her that it's been one time too much (I've warned her before that eventually I might just unwillingly break), and that I can't take it. I forgave her probably over a hundred times, seriously. And I honestly care about her, and I honestly know she doesn't mean it, and I honestly worry that without me she won't be able to survive. But also I just can't stand being a punching bag anymore, it's emotionally exhausting and I feel drained. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't live my life like this but I can't live my life knowing that my leaving ruined her, which really might happen. Reddit, need your help on restoring friendship Hello there, dear redditors. I truly need your advice and every opinion is highly appreciated, so feel free to express whatever's on your mind. I'll try to keep things as short as possible, so here's the problem. I know a friend of mine since we were 7 and now i'm 23. Recently (for a month or two) i started allowing new people in my life, which is pretty unusual for me and it got so overwhelming and intense that i didn't notice i started building distance with my best friend because i concentrated on new people too much. Eventually we got so far from each other that we barely even talk. We still respect each other and are chatting on occasion trying to look like we're still those "good old friends", but i can tell that he's not okay with the situation, even despite he's trying not to show me that. I know i fucked up big time. He's my best friend that has always been there for me and i won't forgive myself if i'll lose him. So, reddit, what do i do? I know it would be the best just to tell about the situation, but i can't find proper words and it pains me. Thanks in advance.Accidentally kissing my friend after a party, what did i fuck up So there's this situation that happened once a week or two ago that kind of made my pretty-close-but-not-best friend dude friend feel...distant? I'm not sure but it coincides with the event and theres this subtle awkward "accidentally" distant attitude i feel coming from him, though I apologized for the kiss the very same day by text, that happened the morning after i slept in his bed at his party (we were 5 friends chatting in his bedroom until 6 am and the others left but we fell asleep spooning. madeout when we woke up. He has a girlfriend whos super jelly and absolutely doesnt want him to mess around, even tho he cheated on her a few weeks ago without telling. I have a boyfriend of 2 years that i love as well but we have a history of cheating on eachother and not knowing how to end this. POINT IS, i really wanna have sex with my friend right here. Once or whatever, i don't really care, but i want my hots to go away and while hes only generically attractive, with very bland taste in women (im bisexual af and i don't understand most straight men tastes alright) , hes really more than that and has some kinks i share. Plus, everyone has had some sort of relationship or hookup with eachother in the past in our friend group, and him and I are the only pair that hasn't, so thats kind of anpther thing that makes the idea awkward. Not bright. I don't know what to feel about this. I slept in his bed again last night after an intimate party with our friends because the guest room was busy. At some point I was pretty sleepy and felt his hand on my panties (i didnt have pants on because its uncomfortable), but he was well asleep. I gradually felt a tingling growing round there and it slightly woke me up, and after some time he was starting to give me hand stuff, leaned in to kiss me, and then - maybe it was because i didnt bring my toothbrush and had bad breath, i hope not for the love of god, a few seconds after that he removed his hand from what i literally had been dreaming -fuck my life for making me that horny, grabbed my boob a little and then got his hand back to him and fell asleep. I dont know why he stopped, and thats the most awlward thing : what could that mean? If we had full on sex we could both agree it was wanted but a mistake, and reveal sexual tension between us. But right now it looks like i dont really attract him at all, but he still likes some intimacy, just not with me. Is that your analysis as well? What do you guys read in this? Im well known for liking girls and have  short jaw length cherry red hair. A very cute face but Basically not your typical bombshell. Maybe that's what differences me from other girls he would dig having sex with? Otherwise...im just lost. I have no way of finding out if hes attracted to me in the slighest at the moment , and if we're not meant to bang, i really feel like we lost this kinda vibe in the past months where he would randomly text me every few days and have long, intimate convos about feelings and things happening in our lives, even if were not best friends, we got along well. (We dont really hang out alone together though, that might have happened once or twice only) I really hope i wont lose this definitely from those two awkward, unwanted situations(?) , it would really suck cause I really like him as a friend. im lost without her but I don't know what to do So me and my best friend of about 7 years stopped talking and being friends essentially, around a year ago. We had been fighting a bit before and it kind of led up to this.	0
But yet , i can't help but notice the subtle changes of my outlook , and in how i feel about life . I was 100% happy-go-lucky my entire life until the end phase of 2015 , but then something happened . Not sure when or why , because looking back nothing real bad happened to me , yet i started to feel more and more indifferent as each day passes . At one point i even stopped contacting people around me because i was like "talk is ok but no talk is ok too" , and even today i still feel that way .	1
But most people would be depressed if not for a goal. I think most people would rather not exist than exist if solely to pick cotton in the sun or mine in poor conditions. But people who are not depressed do these things because there's a goal, a reward afterwards. There's a reason to be alive	1
Anyone ever tried walking around all day keeping sitting minimum? What are the effects? I'm thinking of trying it tomorrow. I will just try standing around or walking around all day in my house.I wasn't supposed to live this long I tried to kill myself on my birthday, january 7th, but failed because i vomited up all of the drain cleaner I drank. They kept me in a psych ward for a week. I just came back home and it is kinda surreal given that i packed all my shit up and wrapped up most loose ends the only feeling I can compare this to is like beating an open-world game and just wandering around with nothing left to do. Honestly I am prepared to die but am not willing to overcome my instinctual fear of death again.Why does it seem like everyone's irritated with me all the time? It always feels like people want to get away from me. I feel like my personality make me way too annoying for people to want to be around, unless they have to in the workplace, to which they just get more and more irritated as the hours go by. This isn't just like being in a bad friend group, ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE I know has needed a break from me or told me to go away. Counselors who are getting paid to deal with me make me feel like I'm being too annoying. Maybe I'm talking over them too much or I'm too jittery. I feel like people are always trying to dominate me or shut me down.	1
To say my world is crashing around me is an understatement. I’m just a fucking kid, going through my own battles with myself and now my dad is just *gone.* I didn’t have the best relationship with him but he was a really, really good guy and this stings like a bitch.	1
I am afraid of being a disappointment, and I am afraid of never being a 'conventional,' 'functional' human.  I am second guessing my decision to leave. I already have other opportunities presenting themselves to me and I am lucky enough to have some money put away... but I don't want to be a failure.	1
Oh and becomes this, I have fucking health problems.. So who knows how long I'll be alive anyway. Life is unfair.. So life can go fuck itself. I'm out. Negative PTO balance Just started a job about 6 months ago and I'm already negative on PTO because it's often too hard to make it out of bed due to crippling depression/overwhelming anxiety/etc. I also had a switch in depression meds, which wreaked havoc on my brain for several weeks.	1
Maybe one day I will end this crusade against myself, against the past. I can't change it, I can't alter the story, I can't lie to myself.	1
Work a lousy job 40+ hours a week. Force yourself into social situations. Come home to do errands and busy work. If you're lucky, a hobby or two in any free time you may end up having. Sprinkle in some random tragedies and unforeseen hardships and repeat on loop for 60 odd years.	1
Throughout my time at the new university, there were a lot of ups (meeting a close friend and actually making personal connections with people, excelling at the courses in my major) and downs (failing multiple classes and having to proactively withdraw due to 'special circumstances,' finishing an entire bottle of wine in an hour, crying and writing gibberish about how guilty I felt then inviting some random 30 year old I had met on Tinder over to my dorm room), but slowly I was piecing it together. I eventually got an on-campus job, then a full time internship then a full-time job.	1
At one point, the alcohol wasn’t enough. Things had only gotten worse at home and I needed a new escape. The first time I did it, it was a pair of scissors. It was small, barely noticeable. I had sworn after the first time that I would never hurt myself again. But eventually I did, and when I left for college it had only gotten worse.	1
Person: "Sigh. Straight up denial? Really? Well what do you plan to do about it?"	1
I can't even avoid the toxicity of politics because that is what my degree is in. I spent the last year trying as hard as I could to think of any reason to keep going. I can't find one. I wrote my first suicide note last month all about my feeling of meaninglessness in a country that killed the country I loved.	1
If someone has no family, no friends and has been bullied/abused by everyone they've met in life, perhaps their social situation really IS as bad as all that.	1
Things started to crash after the accident, I lost people really good friends and I knew it was me, and I changed and something during that accident had altered me, and I hated it. I started to forget people very quickly and events that had happened and horribly people who had died and continuously not realising they had died. That upset a lot of people. Before everything happened I had broken up with a girl (but i didn't realise that after), now I can't remember what we did together or even how we met, but I can't get the thought of her out my head, she later told me to leave never come back, which I did. But even now I still have the feeling of thought of her, and I'm struggling to get rid of that, I don't love her and I'm not in love her, I just feel like i'm obsessed with her a person I know nothing about and It haunts me.	1

And every fucking time im around people i just dont know why i put on this fucking mask, a fucking emotional mask, i pretend like im happy and im having fun when really im fucking dying on the inside, im tired, im fucking tired of living, im tired of money, im tired of problems, the only thing i want right now is a pack of cigs and absolute silence and peace.	1
I talked with her and we set small goals to rekindle and help her find her happiness. We got back together with in two weeks and that started a prolonged honeymoon period for which we traveled, went on ski trips, took our dogs on hikes, and generally enjoyed ourselves.	1
Cannot do basic tasks. I can't even lace my shoes properly.My long-term relationship ended without a breakup conversation. My bf just ghosted me and stopped talking to me without any explanation. I’m feeling very depressed and need some advice? I (22/f) found out through Instagram that my long-term bf (23/m) was cheating on me with multiple women. I’ve noticed the last month together he’s been distant and acting strangely. Now all his strange behavior makes sense.	1
Versus an unhealthy coping mechanism like drinking or cutting, what are your more healthy options for coping with depression?Does depression make you forgetful? I don’t know what to do. My depression is so bad lately because of everything going on and having 0 downtime, that I’m beginning to forget things....and I’m afraid my boss has noticed. Depression does this, right? Or is it more of a medication thing?Why doesn't the military care I've been in for almost 3 years now and for the past 2 years I have not been my self. I can't sleep at night, I find no joy and anything at all anymore I literally hate the world all because of the navy. I've asked for help a year or so back and when I got the chance to talk to a chaplin and explain how I just hate the navy and what's it's done for me all he told me was that it's good I'm in and I need to suck it up and move on.	1
Is there a way to discover myself? Is that even an actual thing? What am I missing in my life? I just want to look forward to living another day rather than dreading it.	1
( I didn't post to suicide watch because I've been having these thoughts so long I don't think I'll ever do it, even though I probably should. I'm just dramatic) I used to be so creative, and funny I used to enjoy writing, drawing and making people laugh. Now I'm just a shell of self hatred, and constant doubt. My social skills are out the window, I'm always awkward. I used to write short stories, and I haven't done that in several years. My drawing skills haven't advanced since I was a teen, which is is sad because if I had continued drawing, I would of been a lot better than I am now I bet. :/ I'm trying to slowly build up my artistic love by using adult coloring books, and doodling models.	1
I barely have the energy to clean my apartment anymore, wash my clothes or think about my hygiene. I feel tearful occasionally on some days.	1
Stranger: id have to probably have a caretaker	1
i should stop complaining i should stop complaining and shut the fuck up. or maybe the thoughts should shut the fuck up. i don’t deserve any of the happiness i have left. i don’t deserve any of the kindness i’ve gotten in the past. i’m a piece of shit. i want to desperately stop existing but i don’t want to leave my boyfriend behind. i think i’m lying to myself half of the time anyway. one moment i’m self loathing, the other i’m not. does that mean i’m just unstable? unstable and stupid? am i over-exaggerating? because i don’t think it’s a big deal that i cut myself and i want to die.What is your interpretation of happiness? Everyone seems to be fixated about obtaining it. Yet when I ask them what happiness is, no one seem to be able to truly give me a definite answer. How can one knows he/she attains happiness when that person doesn't even know what it is in the first place? Its like desperately trying to look for an item in your room but you don't know what that item even looks like.	1
Edit 2: Wow this blew up, in my point of view anyways. I'm going to talk to them, and cut out whoever is still toxic about it. I'm going to try hard to make new friends. **I WILL MAKE A PART 2 TO THIS IN MAYBE A WEEK OR TWO, JUST TO UPDATE WHAT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE GONE/ARE GOING THROUGH THIS AND I WANT TO HELP THEM IF I CAN WITH MY CURRENT STUGGLE**	1
Jesus, I woke up to my inbox busting at the seams! Thanks for all the advice and kind words. Definitely going to continue the path today. Seems daunting to give up my smokes but cutting down got a lot easier with all of your support. Have a great day folks! I just don't enjoy life. I don't enjoy my life at all. I'm constantly bored, miserable and lonely. I haven't felt happiness in about eight years and don't see any signs of happiness in the future. I don't want to live but I don't want to die. Does anybody else feel this way?I love you all Sometimes that is all we need to hear to help us push through. Everyday is a challenge and a struggle but we get through it however we can. That's true strength. I love all of you amazing people who fight every second of everyday. You are not worthless or weak, you are brave, important and loved. If anyone ever wants to talk, rant, be friends, PM me and I will be there.	1
Every day is almost total isolation. I go to class. I fantasize about working up the courage to talk to someone or say something in class but never do. I go back to my apartment. My randomly assigned roommates, all several years younger than me, keep to themselves. I am too afraid to talk to them. So I hole up in my small room and play video games or do homework. Day in. Day out. Rinse. Repeat. This has been my life for several years now.	1
Right now I don't know if I should cut my ties as well, as I can't forgive someone who broke my mom's heart and also someone who can't be contented at all. I'm 24 and take full responsibility on her. Our little family is all what my mom have, as she never worked her whole life and expended it to nurture us her children, giving up her career and dreams.

Stranger: and if you seriously feel depressed, consider going to a doctor/therapist, as there could be less serotonin in your brain that the average person	1
Last night was the first time I’ve felt really suicidal in a while (mostly I’ve just been miserable and haven’t even been motivated to plan my suicide). Why go through all these awful, invasive treatments when I could just end it quickly and quietly and then everyone else could get back to their lives? I feel like an immense burden.	1
I'm not sure, not sureDoes anyone else feel really bad for people who work dead end minimum wage jobs? I've worked 3 minimum wage jobs in the past few months. I just can't stand being treated like I'm replaceable and being worked to death for a small sum of money. I finally had enough and am looking at going back to a computer science degree that I dropped out on a year ago. This got me thinking, have any of you ever felt really bad for someone who has worked at a dead end job for 10+ years?Opening up to people is a waste of time. Fuck this shit. I'm never opening up or talking about my feeling ever again. I'll just let them die with me. No one understands. No one cares. Everyone critisises you. I'll let them stay inside me and fucking go crazy. I'll never ever tell anyone what I'm feeling and my problems ever again. I start my first job tommorow I've been a lurker here for a long time. I'm 19 m, and I somehow finally got motivated enough to apply for and somehow qualify for a job. College has been really up and down for me, but somehow something good happened for once. Idk I just wanted to share, I'm super nervous but I thought some of you might be able to relate to how much this simple thing means to me.Debunking “stigma” Everybody who questions psychiatry often gets the response “you’re stigmatising people with mental health issues”	1
My uncle passed in early September, sending most of my family into a pretty bad state, and only a week later, my girlfriend decided she was done with me, because she was afraid that if she recovered from her depression with me around, then she'd equate me with happiness, and if I left her then she wouldn't be able to recover. (Which ended up being mostly a made up way of saying, I don't love you anymore, but I don't have the courage to tell you.) Obviously, it wasn't fair to her to be stuck with me if she wasn't happy with me, but there were so many better opportunities for her to break things off, and she chose the one that was the most tedious and mentally draining for me. My state of mind after it ended wasn't great at all, and I said some very mean things to her after it ended, (I guess, at the time, I thought it was constructive criticism, but it was all just mean and awful and embarrassing.) Understandably, she hasn't talked to me since, and I feel like I burned any bridge towards reconciling with her.	1
I think the reason why I forget is because the front end has a tendency to have its employees to have erratic working schedules thus it doesn't help when some of the employees go to college on their days off.  I'm twenty five year old woman who doesn't go to college because I'm not too wild about school.	0
I have depression and I sometimes recognize when I’m starting to fall into a pit of despair and I try my best to avoid it all costs- it is almost impossible to crawl back out!I was so happy last week. I spent a week with my long distance boyfriend for our anniversary. It was the happiest I'd been in weeks. I knocked a few things off my bucket list, like casinos, a septum piercing, and walking barefoot in the gulf of Mexico.	1
And my mom keeps calling me every other month telling me she’s gonna kill herself because she feels like nobody loves her. Even through I bent over fucking backwards trying to help her by bringing my brothers to see her and making sure they could talk.	1
The last couple of months have been really hard. He has overtime gotten more worried about his health and every time is convinced that it’s cancer or something else deadly.	1
The only thing I have is that I’m in fairly good shape and my GPA is 3.8 (although that’s certain to go down after this week, which scares the ever-living shit out of me because it feels like the only real thing I can put on my resume). I’m also fairly consistent with working out; it’s not a huge part of my life, but holy shit, if I didn’t do it I can’t imagine how depressed I’d be. Right now, all of the emotional energy I have for the day goes to getting myself to the gym at the least.	1
Is it bad that I am kind of mad my friend never follows my advice? The friend in question and I have been friends for over 7 years and best friends for the last 3 years and have shared just about every detail of our life. I am a very observant person and have seen many repetitions in her behavior over the last years. The heading is a bit misleading here. I am not mad at her that she doesn’t follow my advice. Rather, I am somewhat annoyed that she keeps making the same mistakes with the same toxic people in her life. I have been telling her that many of the people she surrounds herself with are very manipulative and are using her in one way of another as she has actually realized that, however she can’t seem to actually do anything about this and keeps sacrificing her own needs to satisfy those of the people around her. This doesn’t just happen once or twice, but it happens almost on a daily basis and I can basically feel her mental stability deteriorating. I have been telling her for forever that she should focus on her personal growth and leave the toxic people in her life behind. I know that that is super hard to do and super easy to says and that you can’t follow that super easily and I have been trying very hard to be as supportive as I can and listen to her and be a shoulder to cry on. But it’s also very hard to see her being hurt over and over again by the same type of people or even the same person when there is a solution to the problem. And it seems like she isn’t learning and instead she is just getting more and more insecure and anxious and her panic attacks are increasing in frequency because of these people. And it also makes me very anxious when I constantly worry about her. But I don’t want to guilt or manipulate her into any decisions. And I don’t know what to do. help pls im desperate. Need feedback: what do you do with your used toys? Hello parents	0
I'm very annoyed with this because I never used to be physically exhausted like this before and doctors seem to just dismiss it as depression when I'm positive my depression isn't so bad it's ONLY making my physically exhausted and not having any other emotional affect on me. I'm frustrated so, if anyone can answer this it'd be helpful so I can see what avenue to pursue next.	1
Stranger: not a lot at once	1
In February, I received a call from my paternal grandmother saying my dad needs a loan because he lost his temporary job (he has regular seasonal employment) and employment-insurance benefits have recently been changed where he lives. I called my dad and he asked for a loan of $5,000. I felt sorry for the guy, so I wired him the money. After further thought, I feel this is quite a bit more than he needs to be homeless for a few months and carry his credit card payments until getting new employment.	0
Is there anyone that has been cured and not worries about depression creeping back? How did you do it?I started volunteering with the Red Cross to help with my anxiety and depression They fired me from volunteering for not having good enough attendance. I'm really trying to help myself through volunteering and it really hurts that I can't even do that.I don’t think I was cut out to survive in the world. I can’t make phone calls. I can’t drive. I can’t get a job and work like everyone else. I get stressed out and anxious over everything. I’m 21, only had one job that lasted 3 months. I’m graduating and leaving college behind soon. I know I won’t be able to make it in the working world like everyone else. I don’t think I was supposed to live past high school. I add nothing to the world. I am a leech on society. Maybe They are Wrong About It All We are always told "when you are depressed, your brain is lying to you about how bad everything is".	1
I lived in the house with him for a few more months while I looked for a job. A was incredibly distant, and became more and more hostile over time. I got a job on a crab boat. I had a few reasons for doing it, but the most important reason in my head was that I might be lucky enough for it to kill me. The day I moved out A sent me a 6 paragraph essay over text, detailing everything I'd ever done that had disappointed him, and letting me know that there was nothing I could ever do to win his respect back.	1
Stranger: and you dont have to stay engaged with society a lot, it will always be there	1
Then my heart gets broken. She tells me that she can’t see a future with me together. She tells me that she’s only interested in women. There wasn’t much for me to do but respect her true feelings. I couldn’t force her to love me. For a few weeks I lost my best-friend and my future.	1
I was really angry. I still am. I told her that I don't have any feelings for her girlfriend and that I would never do something to her on purpose. She just doesn't listen. Her girlfriend is also tired of her but she can't say no to her and she doesn't want to break up.	0
I am fully aware of the fact that things don't come if you just sit and wait, but I can't bring myself to do anything other than complain. Meanwhile I feel like my mind wants to run, but doesn't know which way to go, and my body won't budge. I think 24/7 about how I'm getting older, and I'm wasting every second of my life. I'm completely lost and feel like everything I do is going nowhere. And I don't even know how to end this post, just wanted to put this somewhere and hopefully get some solutions or words of encouragement from people who've been through the same. Sorry for the long read.Questionable at best So I've been having depression/anxiety problems since middle school, I have suicidal thoughts time to time, but I have no desire to act on them? I don't mean to waste anybody's time, but sometimes it's really odd, I get these thoughts all the time usually after something angers me or upsets me, but later on I just continue with my day. My depression isn't too serious, I've had small attempts, like holding a hand full of pills but never going through with it. My anxiety seems to be more severe than any other problem I have. I'll be at work, just doing whatever and bam, I get anxious out of nowhere. I try breathing exercises to no avail, eventually it goes away.. I usually smoke a bunch of weed and that seems to work but I can't do that at work or anything, anything I can do to help with that without drugs?Eating meals alone at college has to be one of the single worst feelings one can experience at college I feel awful right now, orientation was okay i guess, made a few acquaintances but thats it, i feel i dont really have any friends yet, i just transferred to this school, living on my own for the first time, and ive always struggled making friends, and just sitting here in the dining hall by myself just makes me want to burst into tears, maybe going away isnt and never will be for me :/, sucks how my whole life i cant seem to make friends, then finally i make 2 really good friends and i move away and im back to square one, fuck me seriously, i just cant winEveryday I wake up and get into character Do any of y’all ever feel like you get up and get into character? Like the real you isn’t conscious? I get up go to work, talk to people and say what is expected to be heard but I never say what I’m truly thinking. They ask me “how are you?” I answer back “good” quickly but don’t really think about it. I smile when I lock eyes with someone, I greet everyone enthusiastically, on the outside looking in people think I’m the happiest person but really I’m not at all.	1
Around November-ish time I began to suffer with very extreme bouts of depression. I felt awfully ashamed- here I was living the dream I had longed for for about a decade, and I was here for some reason feeling absolutely dreadful. Even if I had had a fun day, I still had this lingering sadness, and I would get home and cry. I started seeing a counsellor which was one of the best decisions (or rather, my long distance boyfriend decided for me) I ever made.	1
I thought it was normal to not see color, to not ever be excited, to want to drink until my body was as numb as my mind. I wondered how other people could live life with relative stability and thought I was weak for not knowing what they knew. To me, it seemed like common knowledge that life was pointless and ultimately a waste of time. I didn't understand why I was the only one that couldn't cope with that fact. When I was home over a break, I told my mom that I had accepted I would never be happy. When my mom said she was hurt by that, it didn't even occur to me why. I thought I had learned the secret that everyone else knew, the secret that let them go to class or work or see friends or make friends.	1
Make sure to strive for a more regulated sleeping schedule as well and something to keep your mind stimulated without an electronic screen.	1
I just had my 4th funeral in 7 years for yet another Marine. A few days ago another one called me with a gun to his head and i talked him down.	1
Just wish I wasn't so damn shit. Wish I wasn't ugly. Wish I had a body I was proud of. Wish women didn't look down on me like I have the plague. Wish I had something to be proud of.Ever just sit there and wonder what's the point? Is it all really worth it? The hard work. At the job,  on you're self.  And whatever else.	1
I don't want a job.	1
I feel unimportant, I feel un-unique (is this even a word? words are hard), I feel exhausted. I don't know what to do. Even now I feel stupid for writing this on the freaking Depression subreddit.	1
And the worst part is I am still here	1
All I see in my future is homelessness and destitution because I came into adulthood with absolutely zero interests, special memories, or relevant/helpful past experiences. My memory of my life in general is so goddam hazy at this point, if I ever did have those things, they have long been gone to the abyss. I just think why. Why do I have to be so broken and dysfunctional among everyone else? I’m not even a real person. I’m a complete shell of what could have been a person. This is too difficult to come to terms with, while impossible to argue against. It is true. It is my reality. It honestly just makes me angry, bitter, and jealous of others, at a very deep, fundamental, human level, for what the healthy people have. I fantasize about taking two AR-15s and unloading on people. Maybe I know them, maybe I don’t, it wouldn’t matter. Often lives completely lose their value when my headspace gets dark enough. Not as the result of an “illness” but of the fact that I am who I am both physically and psychologically. Blind rage. That is what the result of my dysfunction is. Pure fucking anger at both the world and myself. Unable to cope with my grim reality, all I want to do is destroy.	1
He hasn’t been doing so well for a few days. Yesterday his legs gave out and he was stuck on the bed with his lungs in pain if he lay on his back. For 24 hours, no sleep, food, or drink. Many more problems that I cannot remember, and he’s been feeling like shit emotionally too due to family issues.	1
Problem is, as we spend each week almost always hanging out 3 or 4 days out of the week. I find it harder to come to terms with us never being together. She's never dated, but she tells me about guys she's liked, little things that happened to her like small romantic contact like "holding hands". She has A LOT of guy friends that she's close with, and a few girl friends that she's really close with. And though it only bothered a little back then, it's something I'm jealous of now. Each time I see her, I first think to myself "be normal, be funny, don't show any signs that you may still have feelings" and it works.	1
As far back as I can remember, whenever I've tried to join a group conversation I've gotten weird looks, or people not understanding what I'm saying. I've learned that the less I say, the less awkward people will be around me, and I hate it. Thoughts on Antidepressents? What's the general consensus on antidepressents? I'm considering using them.I do want to live...just not like this. I remember when I used to be so happy at the world. Full of opportunities, believed that you could be anything you wanted, yadda yadda yadda...	1
I'm not even thinking suicide. I'm just thinking like life pretty much has a depressed shade over it. Probably from me recovering from withdrawal.	1
Basically, I don't want to settle for what my life is right now. I don't want to accept a cheap, easy job. I don't want to accept my poor mental health, and I don't want to take any of the medicine I'm given. I don't want to live with my parents. I think my mom's not smart, and my step-dad has always been an angry alcoholic. I remember the feeling that he hated me ever since my childhood, but then I think he has trouble understanding people. I don't want to be any of the things I hate, and I became very hateful ever since that feeling and the mind fog started.	1
The best way I could describe my depression is voices in my head saying mean and awful things to me, about me, about what other people are thinking or saying about me, turning positives into negatives etc.	1
I don't even know how I'd be able to take care of a pet, let alone any kids. It's a really good thing I don't want kids, because I'd be a terrible, neglectful mother. I'd hardly have any energy to make them food, let alone entertain them. I don't understand how people can clean and do laundry and brush their teeth every day. They're mountains to me. Really struggling with self image - any tips to build self confidence? I have struggled with my overall view of myself for as long as I can remember - in particular with my weight. Where im at, at the moment feels like the worst its ever been, I keep having full blown melt downs about how much I repulse myself. Throughout my life Ive been on more diets than I can count and tried multiple different excercise routines. About 4 years ago I gained 30kgs really fast and after moping and feeling sorry for myself i decided i would kick it up a notch and started taking things really serious. 6 days a week at the gym, personal training, strict meal plans - the works. This worked so well at the beginning, I dropped 18kgs in the first few months. It came to a halt and for the past 3 years I've continued to lose weight slower - im at about 25 kilos down in total now. I thought I would be further along by now.	1
Mind you I turn 20 years old tomorrow.	1
The story ended with a shoehorned but unbearably happy ending where the main character gets married, settles in with his newfound friends, and all's good for the time being. You know, the typical "insert generic ending here" bullshit.	1
I think about dying sometimes. Why we're here, what's the point if it ends the same. I doubt I'd ever kill myself because there are things I care about here that I wouldn't leave behind like that, mainly my mom and brother. I worry my brother will end up like me.	1
Then I messed up. I was influenced by a terrible person to say some things I shouldn't have. We went to the same community college like we planned but three years passed without ever seeing each other because we were fighting.	1
Stranger: like random ass things	1
Last week i finally decided to adopt a new cat after so much time and she just disapeared while I was out of the house. My father says he just turned his head for a while and she was gone. I've been searching for her all day. Feeling hopeless, lonely and useless. I shouldn't have left the house yesterday.	1
But I‘m just a fraud. Nothing helps. Afterwards I just want to die more.	1
And finally, the most recent example. I actually planned on moving out. I needed a 10-dollar box. I begged and asked for weeks, and it took seemingly forever to buy me that box, but my sister asked for a 300-dollar dress, and she got it bought for her in less than a day.	0
i'm not sure if any of you will get what I'm saying but, eh. I can't even understand myself. God I’m fucking done I put my heart and soul into this girl I gave her all my love and she turns out to be a catfish the fucking nerve of this bitch she told me that when I got raped it wasn’t as bad as hers that fucking whore I gave her everything and she fucking lied to me when my friend died she took advantage of me i fucking hate her I literally loved her so much I gave her everything EVERYTHING I tried to help her as best as I could she fucking Lied that fucking bitch she literally took advantage of someone in grief I fucking hate her on top of all that she said she was gonna black mail me I’m never fucking trusting anyone ever again I’m fucking done I’m gonna kill my self and it’s gonna be her fault the only good things that happened out of all of this I got a baby kitten and that wasn’t even from her. Why me I do everything right and I still get fucked. Ps sorry for grammar Rolling down hill Hi all,	1
I’ve always been pretty good at telling jokes, which is weird since I’m super introverted and if I’m not joking I’m super quiet.	1
The place was pretty clean. An adult area for people 18 and over, rooms and halls split by gender. Bathrooms only seemed a bit off towards the end of the day or during the morning when people would shower. Roommates were sweet and tidy thankfully but the option to change roommates if there was a problem was always available to me. Groups were informative and engaging as well as encouraging for others to speak up if they wished. You had a good amount of personal time to do whatever. Outdoor activities were available permitting the weather. The place was meant for short stays of up to a week so anyone who's still there for longer may see the groups as too repetitive. The food was surprisingly delicious and great. Honestly expected school lunch type of food but there was variety and options for those allergic, vegetarian or needing gluten free food. There were staff members around whenever you needed them for anything.	1
I just want to forget her.The only sign of order is that I make my bed every morning Everything else is complete chaos.Don't want to live, don't want to die. I just want to stop existing. Vanish into thin air without a trace and wipe my entire existence off the face of the planet. I don't want anyone to love me or miss or care about me. I don't remember the last time I was actually happy and I don't see things ever getting better because they've been bad for so long. Nothing ever changes no matter how hard I try. I can't stand being alone, but when I'm around anyone I just want to isolate. I can't eat because I get sick after 2 bites. I can't sleep because I have nightmares or always dream about undesirable things. I just don't know anymore. This isn't living, but whatever it is, I don't want to do it. "Life has no meaning the moment you lose the illusion of being eternal." This quote fucked me up. I have been constantly struggling to find meaning in my life and then I come across this quote and it absolutely drains me. It is validation for my worries and pain. I just want this to be over.There are so many things I want to say to people, things I want to type... But in the end, no matter how much of that text I wrote or how much I think about what to say, I delete it in the end.	1
So, earlier this year after some lack of focus and insistent lethargy eventually my parents decided to take me to a psychiatrist. One thing leads to another and I am diagnosed with depression and put on a dose of escitalopram (generic form of Lexapro) 20mg a day. Have a history of depression on my mother's side, and they had all the symptoms pretty severely minus the suicidal ideation, which I believed supported their diagnosis.	1
We had planned to meet at 2pm, but at 2pm he asks if we can meet at 5pm because 'the weather is too hot'. Fair enough, so we decide to meet at 5pm.	1
Recently, I was attempting to get into a ketamine study in a NYC hospital and was asked a number of questions about my background. One item which came up that I have not thought about in a while was the specifics of my uncles suicide when I was around 13.	1
I hope this is the proper sub for this and I would be very thankful for your advice.Looking for Friends I’m looking for people to talk to about my depression. An online friendship, I guess. I just have no one in my life who understands what I’m going through and it makes dealing with this much worse. I don't even know I don't know if I'm depressed or just the good 'ol sad. I can't fully express how I feel because the inside of my head is a mess.	1

What. The. Actual. Fuck. I slept in the same room with them for 17 years, and today I found out that both of them have been doing messed up shit and I was completely oblivious, up until today. It's so scarring, and I remember myself pretending I'm asleep. I knew before that my mum didn't wear a bra to sleep, but I really didn't know it might be more than just because it was more comfortable to sleep without one. Lmao.	0
You: it's hard to know what to do	1
I think I secretly had an understanding of how he had killed himself even when I was a kid and was not told due to subtle hints that kids will typically pick up on. Even if I did not, I always had the feeling that something was wrong and that my parents were not truthful.	1

She then proceeded to recount to me all of the myriad ways she's nearly died on some of the trips she's taken.	1
Due to school payments, and buying a car, it is not possible to move out with the mediocre job that I have. There is still another year until I graduate school, and even then I don't know for certain if I will be able to get a job that will enable me to move out. I will still have to pay off school loans after that. The thought of staying here for another year, or even worse 2-3 years is completely unbearable. My girlfriend and I have made plans to move out together eventually, but that probably wouldn't happen for another 2 years minimum. This had made me extremely depressed and anxious the past 6 months. Does anyone have any advice for what I should do? I have been considering spending more time at libraries during the day.  I have also been trying to spend a little more time outside and at the gym etc. But if anyone else has been in a similar situation, please give me advice.	1
Before I knew it, I couldn't even remember the last good day I had or even the last time something went right for me.No end in sight I have been depressed for so long.  I just feel a void,dark and empty.  I can  feel the pain of no one loving me. I have zero friends.  I live with toxic parents .I feel like i have been in an endless loop with   no end in sight to the pain I'm in.  I hate my existence. I have done therapy,yoga blah blah. I still feel miserable. I am so unlucky. Can't do anything right.  What's the point if you're not good at anything. Im  below average in life,no money,No job,No talent and no interest. I don't get it.  Why am I even here?Poem about mental illness I wrote When you ask if I'm okay Of course I am okay. I am alive, But not quite living. I am okay but I am trapped, Watching those around me Live their lives. I am okay but I feel lost, Or rather I cannot feel at all. I am okay but I am screaming As loud as I can inside my head. I want to be heard But suffer in silence. I am okay but other's are not I make them feel helpless As they watch me sway Between okay and isolation. Isolation from others From myself From my passions. Isolated from my own feelings Sometimes there's nothing left but the dark. You feel helpless? I am helpless I am drowning in the darkness. I am okay But I'm not really here Here or there I'm everywhere My brain can't straighten up. I'm okay but I'm not living I feel trapped within myself. I am not okay.I felt happy the other day and now I'm worse off I went on a date the other night, my first one in a very, very long time. It went surprisingly well and the guy was really sweet and understanding. The whole date I felt the overwhelming sense of loneliness I struggle with disappear. My mind was clear and I was able to be quick witted, funny, and upbeat. I was happy for the first time in ages.	1
Today my dad died at 42.	1
But I am scared of death. I wish I was religious so I had some motivation for either killing myself and going to heaven, or for fear of hell having motivation and stay alive. What if it hurts? What if the nothingness is unbearable?	1
I do most of those things in private, when no one’s home (excluding the random screaming I do at night). I don’t want my mom to worry about me like she does my diagnosed depressed big brother, and also her dealing with my little brother’s life (He’s 7). On top of all that my mom is a single mom and barley has time for her own life and gets sad easily. (The sight of my mom sad deeply pains me inside) I’ve always been the one kid that could take care of himself. She has even told me personally that she is glad that she doesn’t need to worry too much about me (only deals with my back pain, she takes me to rehab).	1
Also, I forgot to mention that I smoke weed daily. I heard that it can make depression worse and I've been using it for almost two years now. Is this something I should only do at night? I originally used it for sleep. How do you get through bad days? I’m having an exceptionally bad day today and I’m having trouble getting through it. I’m afraid this feeling won’t ever go away.dropped back into a depression, feels like i️ travelled back in time anyone else feel like this?	1
I partly attribute it to the fact I had a really awful teacher in my first semester here. Now, I think some people might think that this might be a cultural shock issue, but I am pretty sure that she was crossing ANY acceptable line, no matter what culture. Firstly she would be very rude to me in front of all my classmates. Say if I came in without makeup, in jeans (like, still showered, hair done, not sweatpants or anything, just not completely dolled up) she would say in front of everyone 'Your face isn't pretty enough to not wear any makeup. You are scaring everyone. You know girls in Japan care about their appearance. You should do too, for everyone's sake'. (Also my Japanese is perfectly adequate to understand interactions like that, so I know for a fact that this wasn't a language barrier issue. ) If I got a question wrong in class she would say 'You know, I don't know why I bother asking planyourspontaneity for answers, she is so useless'. Or if we had to make example sentences she would pick examples like 'What does planyourspontaneity need? Oh planyourspontaneity needs to learn how to make some friends'. And this became like a running joke in my class. I have never been bullied, so I never learnt to grow a thick skin, so this (what felt like) daily victimisation began to really grate and tear down my self esteem. I felt isolated so my social anxiety caused me to isolate myself, and people ignoring me, creating a vicious circle. I began to be completely mute in class, ignoring the teacher, be on my phone, having headphones in, and this obviously spurred her on as she would berate me for how I was a terrible student. Also I feel like it might be relevant to say how I told this teacher that the reason why I was so withdrawn and using my phone a lot was because my stepfather was undergoing cancer treatment and I was worried (this was true). But she still kept calling me useless and 'the worst student I have ever taught' to everyone. If I seemed withdrawn though she would stroke my thighs and lower back and neck (I think this contact thing might be a cultural difference but still) in front of everyone, which obviously made them think I was a total freak. If I made eye contact with them, they would quickly shuffle away or look disgusted.	1
I don’t know why I posted this. I suppose I just want to tell somebody.Well i think i am good now After a long time with depression (3-4 years) i can say that i am feeling good.i feel that way 4-5 months now but i wasnt sure. My therapist helped me a lot (still visiting her) and my ex-friend but now girlfriend too (even if we have fights often i know at the end that she cares about me). Last september i was ready to suicide i didnt like anything not even smoke weed like i usually do or play video games. I was lying in bed/couch crying all the time and complain that i dont have future and i will be forever alone.Thank god back then my family and my dog(ye my dog,was one of reasons that i didnd hurt myself) helped me a lot.Now i have dreams again i am looking for job i am planning with my girlfriend to move  to north europe and ofc i am smiling more than before. I know that i am still depressed i am not healed 100%  but  i know i am in the correct way. I wanted to share cause i feel really happy and who knows maybe will encourage some people here.Hope!! How do you guys make friends in a new city? Moved to a new city after graduating college. It’s been 6 months and I don’t know anyone. I was really depressed in college, but I guess since I graduated I’ve “upgrading” to just feeling numb/indifferent to everything as opposed to feeling down.	1
Seriously, if you only knew the half of it.  The card she wrote for me for my birthday alone would have anyone convinced.	1
I would drop out right now but i know that my family would look down on me. They think the only way out for me is school, and I hate school with a passion and manage to blow it off everytime. I feel like I could go back to college, you know, go back and get the shit u need. But where I’m at right now.... working only 20 some hours and managing to be broke every week from drug use and other stuff from being so stressed and unhappy. I personally feel I would enjoy my life so much better if I didn’t have school right now. I’ve never said that and I just wanted to tell someone.	1
And yet, though a part of me yearns for light, for the warm comfort of the sun, it only depresses me. In the light I can see what I truly am, I can see a reflection of something I've grown to hate. When I look at my reflection I want to smash the mirror so I can no longer see the truth of my insignificant existence. In the light I can see everyone else, either continuing on with their lives without a thought of me or a second glance. Or I see other people like me suffering and it both hurts and gives me a strange, and possibly, a cruel comfort. I hate seeing other's suffer, but I'm so insignificant I am helpless that I might as well be dead...	1
I'm looking for a low-cost way to talk about my symptoms, even an alternative to real "talk therapy". I was in a MSBP-type situation where as a young adult I was forced into therapy when I wasn't ready, and made to discuss what should have been patient protected information with my family after my sessions, so I'm hesitant to "get into" that again after the experience.	1
I’m sorry to everyone I hurt. Hopefully I get my well deserved punishment eventually.For the first time in my life i liked this girl and when she left life around me doesn't make sense. Why does this pain happen to people This is my first time and please i need some answers on what to do, why does life work this way, i fucking hate that things had to go wrong this fucking way. My depression is taking over me and my family is worried about me. For the first time in high school i liked this girl for about 7 months and during that time we became best friends and i always thought she would like me if i cared for her and treated her right. i always acted the same way as her and found out we thought the same sometimes. We always talked to each other including late night till 2 or 3 am and we knew everything about each other and we always were with each other but instead she liked some asshole who didn't like me and always kept lying about me to her. She never believed what he said about me but chose to love him and be with him more and they always were with each other after class and it made me jealous and angry on why she would do this. One day i invited her to some place with her and my friends but she decided to also want to take the asshole and i got frustrated and ended our friendship. she got angry at me and decided to leave too. but one day the asshole decided to leave her because of a fight they had and she starts crying to me on the phone and i try to help her get over him but it hurts me when she says she loves this person who kept lying to her about me and other things and he was known to be a bad person and she only dated one guy before but he was super nice and i didn't understand why she liked him and she said she didn't either, it was only that she felt happy around him. She is such a pretty girl and most of the guys in the school agree and thought me and her were dating but they never knew she really liked this asshole and during the time they hanged out she kept asking me if they were right for each other and she said she would separate from him but she didn't listen to me. Instead they got closer and me and this asshole got into more fights with each other but she would rather not say anything and still be with him. Now she is actually separating from him after all this time. Why did she do this to me after everything we've been through because i treated her way better but she did this to me and i dont know should i go back to her after what she did. Its been 2 weeks and i haven't talked to her since then and my mind has been thinking of ways to beat myself up because of this problem. Everyone knows im depressed but at this point i couldn't care and im losing my mind and i just need some answers of why she liked this asshole but not me.If people treated broken arms like they treated depression... Person: "He dude, your arm is broken in half. You should probably call for help".	1
Stranger: not sure	1
Most of the people in my life only ever knew my outer shell. The somewhat false personality that I put on in order to function. Over the last three years my mask has been crumbling away and the results haven't been pretty. It's been a viscous feedback loop that leaves me feeling worse and worse as people fall out of my life one by one, either by their own choosing or because I distance myself to hide my pain as I become less and less able to handle it.	1
"No one will love you if you are unattractive..." my family looks like the cover of a magazine and I look like shit.	1
You: yes funny video	1
I know you see the dead look in my eyes and wonder if my meds aren’t strong enough or if you need to remind me yet again that I need to watch for increased thoughts of suicide.	1
Stranger has disconnected.	1
I used to have hopes and dreams, gave up, wasted years getting fucked up, almost died a few times and now I'm trying to fix my life but it's a slow process and I regret 80% of my life	1
And these people never reciprocate the effort you put in because they have a group and you don't. I gotta work 10 times as hard because I didn't get lucky in middle school like these guys...	1
I feel like I just ruin everything, if I'm downstairs with my family, there always seems to be an argument, even if I'm not involved in the argument. But if everyone else is in the living room, whilst I'm upstairs in my own, I can only ever here them laughing and enjoying themselves. It's like, even when I haven't done anything, I seem to just produce a negative atmosphere.	1
What can I do to break the shackles of this bullshit known as depression?!	1
Stranger: idk how ud do it tho	1
The only moments of Bliss I get are sometimes with my boyfriend, I get giddy about thinking about our future, or seeing a selfie he sent me while at work and make me swell. Those are occasional, but the only thing I ever feel that's positive to a somewhat major degree. I think my new birth control (first time on it) has made my depression worse. I don't believe in antidepressants for myself. I've been stressed out so much I've lost a bunch of weight too.	1
Waste hours as thoughts take over and I can't sleep	1
They all mean well, and it’s nice to see that they take it seriously, but I just want to be treated like I’m more than my depression. I won’t hurt myself because you didn’t call me a sweet name like honey and change the tone of your voice to one you would use worth a small child who’s upset.	1
Stranger: just something to do	1
I recently had a really bad breakup with a woman who I had spent almost 3 years of my life with. I'm heartbroken and absolutely lost. She was my world. She told me I was her world. She has found someone else and now claims that most of what we had was fake and now she wants nothing to do with me.	1
So here I am. I don’t know if it’s sad that literally those two things are about all that keep me here or good that I can still find humor in all this. Why? Why do I feel this way? Why am I always tired all the time? Why can't I get out of bed in the morning, take a shower, and be productive? I want to do so much but I just don't seem to care, or have the motivation anymore. A year has passed and everything is the same, I'm living the same day over and over again and I don't know how much longer it will last. Why am I always in my own head? I'm always thinking about the past, just wishing I've done things differently or even did things at all. If only I made other decisions in life maybe I wouldn't be where I am now, tired and alone. Why am I like this? Why was I put into this life of emptiness and failure? I just want it to stop, but at the same time this is all I know, and I just have to except it I guess. Hello from Scotland I just wanted to say hello really.	1
And stand alone in the rain	1
I know this sub moves kinda fast but I just wanted to vent, hopefully some of you read this..	1
I had to wait several months until I got the final answer. Had no therapy in that time between and also we only had like 6 sessions.	1
So, that's where I am. I'm going to go smoke a cigarette and pray that I get my dad's cancer even younger than he did. Losing my mind at 20! So the best label I can put is depression I don’t know if that is what I’m really going through tho long story short I grew up in a pretty bad environment had a single mother (now that I’m older I understand stand that it must of been hard being a single mom but what I was put thru is still no excuse)who was very abusive verbally and physically I remember having brooms broke across my back and head for simply spilling a drink, when I was 16 I was stabbed by mother and was taken to the hospital of course like many children who are abused I did not speak up I guess because of fear but more because I didn’t want to be looked at like a sick puppy over the years I was able to cope with my environment and it became normal the part that I don’t understand is when I was 18 I decided to leave and with no real support I was homeless for a bit I used to set daily goals for myself so I wouldn’t let depression set in like find a job,etc I bought a car with the little money I had and slept in that and went to the gym to shower strangely enough that is when I was at the most happiness I have ever felt flash a year later I’m 19 have an apartment a good job and have the whole world in front of me but I’m not happy and it’s been a year I’m 20 now and feel like I’m 60 I have no drive and think about ending my life everyday I just simply feel numb or like im not connected to body I also didn’t mention that I have siblings and I think about them all the time I think that I’m a terrible person for leaving them to live in that environment when I’m free enjoying life anytime I feel joy it’s instantly sucked from me because I began to think about my siblings and think what they are going thru right now I wonder if they love me or hate me and its been taking a toll on me physically and mentally and at this point I don’t know what to do I haven’t tried reaching out because that would mean I would have to see my mother and I’m no longer afraid of her she simply doesn’t deserve to see me at all I sometimes think when she’s on her deathbed will she ever feel any remorse for what she has done I also think when she goes to take her last breath will she wonder about me she hasn’t seen me since I left and she won’t ever again Any thoughts on what I should do?Sometimes i just think that Dylan Kleboldband Eric Harris were right you know? Fuck this world. I have very few/no friends at school (none of then want to invite me to hangout after school), I’m an ugly piece of shit, short and weak, i have no social life, I don’t get invited to any parties, I’m invisible in the eyes of girls, everyone seems to enjoy high school and are experiencing a normal happy teenage life, and then there’s me. No one cares about me I’m fucking pathetic. I hate my mom she is a piece of shit and i just want her out of my life and sometimes even dead. I’m incel. This world is a shitty place. I’m so scared of what will happen if i somehow manage to literally survive high school.  Will i just work a boring job the rest of my life? Wake up, work, come home, sleep, repeat? What the fuck. No one will even know of me let alone care about me. What if I can’t find something to do when I grow up? Now is my chance to have fun and be a little bad without severe consequences and I’m wasting it away being a depressed shit. I’m missing out. What if nothing changes when I’m too old to make that change? When I’m passed the point of no return? This is no way to live. School is shit. I’m shit. My life is shit. Everything is shit. Fuck.	1
If not I know this will be a big shock and the last thing I want to do is cause any harm. But I don’t want to pass the chance that maybe we could get to know each other, and I really hope that you feel the same way. I live in Radlett so we’re not far apart, and if you wanted to meet for a coffee and a chat one day that would be amazing. I really hope I hear from you, and I hope this doesn’t cause any bad feeling with your family, or between us. I’ll be keeping my fingers crossed.”	0
I wish you all the happiness you deserve.	1
I try to do new things, and I do them well, but it all feels so flat and empty. I don't understand what else I can do to improve. I can feel myself starting to slide back down and it's really scary and frustrating.	1
So, I'm not sure how to go about this. Let him be and try not to freak out until he returns? Advice greatly appreciated. ThanksI am irrelevant No friends (unable to make any)	1
The sunlight drains me quick. And when crossing a street I often triple take even when absolutely nothing is coming.	1
But none of that really matters when you stand in the rain	1
Stranger: im okay with m life because i have all extremities lmao	1
I can go on and on with these stories but I need to get to this... it’s my anxiety. I was diagnosed with depression in high school but was taken off of medication. I was doing actually quite well! But most recently, with everything that’s been going on, it’s gotten really really bad. I am constantly anxed about everything.. when I walk down the street, I fear what people look at me as. Now I’m not fat, I’d say I’m average but my cheeks are so puffy and it really embarrasses me to even look in a mirror. I am constantly wondering why my fiancé wants to be with me, if he is cheating on me, lied to me, etc. I over stress about the smallest smallest things. Example: I cried and broke down because I failed my drivers test for the Oregon license. I physically felt like I was going to die or the end of the world was happening... why? Why was that happening to me? Why is this ALL happening to me? I miss my fiancé, I can’t get stable, I now starting out as an adult isn’t supposed to be easy but guys... this is really hard. I spend any day I have off in bed and I have only had one meal within two days. I know I need help but I don’t have the money for it or the time. I have never felt this insecure about my life, future, body, everything. I feel like I’m climbing up an escalator that’s going the wrong way, and no amount of running will get me to the top.	1
Stranger: is that helpful at all lol	1
Any time I try to help him find a new job so he can leave this job, he completely panics and shuts down and I can't say anything or else he yells. It has gotten so bad recently that I dread waking up in the morning because of the psychological warfare with him. He will do things like saying he wants to self-harm, or he is going to jump out of the car while I am driving.	1
I always feel like I will never achieve my dreams and I am a failure. I have a big dream where I want to help people in those poor countries and volunteer in charity works. The issue that really concern me at the moment is child labor. I hate to see children working to earn money and live in poverty when they are supposed to learn and enjoy their childhood.	1
my boyfriend suffers with bad mental illnesses aswell and he's gone awol and hasn't been online in days nor texted me for months but whenever I do call and the rare chance he answers he reassures me that he still loves me. When he's gone my head is just filled with overthinking and worry that it makes me physically so depressed and worse than before. Does anyone have any fucking help for me?How do i stop negative thoughts? I try to be positive. But honestly the last 2 years has been hard i feel my thoughts are getting worse and worse. I think i am worthless, weak, pathetic and more. And i dont know what to do these thoughts are eating away at me. I can have a good day and then start thinking these thoughts and lose all self confidence. The sad thing is that my friends tell me im worth less also and i try to change as a person to please them. I know i should not hang out with them but then i wont have any friends at all and i will be even more lonely.Never rely on anyone, for even your own shadow leaves you when you are in darkness. Meaning?	1
Anyway, thanks for listening to me whine about my problems.God damn it I'm fucking done. I just suck at everything. I give up. I fucking quit. I cant handle this world I'm too god damn weak. I don't want to go to school, I can't fucking do it. I haven't even registered but classes start in a few hours and now I need to go beg to be let in why do I do this shit to myself. I'm freaking out god damn it I'm running out of time and I keep digging myself deeper into my lies. I just want to cry all day but I can't even cry anymore. I lay in bed all day imagining a better world and a better me that will never come. I'm scared I'll always be disconnected from myself. I don't want to let my family down so I need to keep going to school but fuck I'm gonna fail and either way I'm gonna get kicked out I don't know what to do. And even worse I keep getting told I need to go get a job. My family aready view me as the stupid let down, and not having a job proves it to them. Everyone just thinks I'm lazy and I am because when I come here I see the real shit others have to deal with and my problems are all in my head. Am I sick or just lazy as fuck? And does it even matter? I cant put my feelings into words. Everytime I think things are looking up, I just get shit on. I want to erase myself from history. Everyone else would be so much better off god damn it I'm such a drain. Why do good people have to die while I'm still around? Just take me instead. I'm debating between driving to school in a few hours to try and get the classes I know I'll fail, or just driving off a fucking bridge. I'm sorry for taking attention away from everyone else here who are worse off than my pathetic confused ass, I just needed to do someting to get these feeling out or I'm gonna blow up and screamI adopted a cat Ive been suicidal and planning it out. I went with a friend to look at the humane society for dogs and while we were there my friend wanted to look at cats.	1
Since the beginning of this year, I've been wanting to die; I feel so lonely and as if nobody actually cares about me. So, there's my primary friendship group; the people I hang out with the most. All of my (2) "genuine" female friends pretty much don't give two shits about me because I tend to act really clingy to them and other people because I've been friends with them since first grade and don't want to lose them. One of my female friends is kinda popular and she barely talks to me, and I just feel like I'm undeserving of her time or something; she's also kinda claimed my other female friend, so I don't get as much time to hang out with them as I used to. My guy friends are also a bit popular and they also happen to be dating my two female friends lol. They do make me feel happy talking to them, and I do hang out with them a lot, but sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be hanging out with them all that much because then I'm "stealing" them from my friends. I also get pretty bummed not being in a relationship when my other friends are, and I do feel like I'm not needed amongst any of my friends. (Basically, I just feel like the rebound when one of my friends aren't there).	1
tl;dr - depression &gt; anxiety for me.Random girl asked me awful question today. I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this or not, but I need to get this off my chest.	1
You: maybe. im concerned i will lose touch with society.	1
Shortly after my car died and my depression got to a dark place.	1
But the hospital just seems so miserable, and my psychologist told me if I wanted to go I’d stay until my parents arrived (2 weeks). Also do you get to use your phone and computer in the hospital?	1
I'm just a good guy who didn't come from much and I'm trying my best to live a fulfilling life but I don't think I can anymore because of this illness. I use to be quite a geek as a kid and love video games and playing with others and having fun. I remember when I use to look forward to coming home from elementary school or middle school and just do my homework and then game away. It was so much fun then and I felt like I was genuinely pretty happy. Now a days I feel like i'm just literally dead. I don't do anything, I can't sleep, I hardly eat because I cant find the motivation to go out and get food... and over the past 4 years I have noticed that depression really has taken a toll on me mentally and physically.	1
Why am I even here? As if venting on the internet is going to change anything. I wish she'd love me. I'm 19 and tired of living I'm writing because I don't have anyone else to talk to in real life that could understand me. I'm a 19 years old girl, close to turning 20, never had a relationship in my life and only kissed a boy once. I've had boys hit one me before but I always turned them down. I feel terrible that I've never dated anyone, but in reality I don't even know what my sexuality is and I don't think that I'd be a good partner to anyone. I feel so miserable and sad all the time. I hate my body and my appearance even though I know that I'm not really ugly. I don't know why my self esteem is so low. I don't have energy anymore do anything in my life. I don't have a lot of friends and the ones that I've had in high school I don't talk much to them. I always end up isolating myself from people and the regretting it later. I don't know why I do this. I don't why I hate myself so much. I just wished that I could love myself. I think I'm depressed but I don't know for sure. I went to a psychologist a while ago and all I could do was cry and tell them how miserable I felt and they basically didn't tell me anything and it felt like a waste of money. Anyway, I don't know what I have, I just know that there's something wrong with me. I feel like I've wasted my teenage years away being socially anxious and not connecting with people, and I don't why I am like this. I just wished that I could socialize and be happy and not care so much about how I look and how others perceive me. The year is coming is to an end and I am just feeling terrible because I'm still lonely and depressed and because I'm not in college yet because I didn't study enough for the entrance exam. Anyway, sorry if my English is bad, I've always lurked in this sub and I wanted to post something to know that I'm not alone.Feeling nostalgic? Does anyone else obsess over a point of time in their life when they felt like they were truly happy? For me the last time in my life when I felt like I was truly happy was 2013 and 2014 (mostly the summers) Ever since then life has changed so much. My depression got worse than ever. I spend so much time reminiscing on the good times because life is so crappy now. Does it ever get better again or what? I keep telling myself this is just a stage and things will get good again but it just seems to get worse. Nostalgia can be a great feeling but it’s killing me now knowing how good life once was.Im excited for death I finally dont want to do die but now the idea of dying is exciting. I don't want to take my own life but I'm finding this weird comfort in the fact that I will die one day and I can't waitWhat's the point in continuing with life if I don't enjoy it? I'm trying to make sense of it allHow do you decide to live for yourself? I can't do anything for myself. I don't mean I can't dress myself or shower etc, I mean I don't care to progress my career, I don't care to try and be a better person and all that. I'm finding that I'm putting off whatever I want to do (study for career progression, do martial arts, try harder with photography etc), in place of "being support" for my girlfriend. Emotional or otherwise. I put her above me, so I don't do anything. This is wrong, because it leaves me bitter with myself and my choices, because I want to be better for her etc. But wtf do I do? How do I do it? Can anyone cheer me up? Apparently, my dad used to work in another country. While he was away, my mom allegedly cheated on him several times. The only source of mine is my cousin, who gets the info from my sister. So I guess it is true. And to think about it, she did wear a lot of makeup back then. Not the normal amount I mean. To keep it short, when this hit me, I could not imagine her cheating on my dad. I’ve also heard that they are not divorcing because of me, which is plain stupid. All in all, I am pretty much down, I’ve never thought that she would be capable of doing such a thing. (19 year old guy here)Getting all excited to do something and then canceling at the last moment, for no reason (or: How to Let Down Six Online Acquaintances With One Easy Trick) Last week I set up an online gaming event that was supposed to take place today. It didn't get a whole lot of interest relative to the other things on the forum, but I happened to have scheduled it very close to another event without realizing, so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯, whatcha gonna do. Either way it was enough interest to follow through with it, so fast forward to today...	1
Stranger: idk i kinda view life as a thing which you might as well have	1
They blamed my relationship with my then boyfriend and told me to never speak of this to anyone. They didn’t want people to know I was “crazy”. Was I? During that time, I came to believe I was, but now I understand that I was just broken.	1
Any thoughts on this? I’m not going to text him back until I’ve had some time to think about the right thing to say. Hearing my parents doing naughty things at night scars me. Hey guys, my name is Sally.	0
No one laughed then	1
And let this be a lesson to everyone else. The smallest act can and does make a difference. Let's all try and use the Christmas season to ensure everyone feels a little more loved. Feel like I have a relapse incoming And I cant stop it.	1
My uncle was a 28 yr old gay M, developed HIV and killed himself. Though this is not what I was initially told. It took around 10 years with every year or so getting a new piece of information. Initially I was told he had cancer and died. Then I was told he had cancer and my grandparents "pulled the plug". Then I was told he was gay, had cancer, and my grandparents "pulled the plug". Then I was told he was gay, had HIV, and my grandparents "pulled the plug". Then, finally, I was told he was gay, had HIV and killed himself.	1
Basically, for as long as I can remember I've always cried when someone shouts at me. I think its because my dad used to get really angry often but who knows. Any idea on how to stop this? Today I cried and I haven't cried that intensively for years. I couldn't even stop it after the person stopped shouting at me. It continued for like 10 minutes after. They must think im reallyy weird and weak..	1
The time that we spent apart allowed me to clear my head. Before, I used to think about her all the time. Now, days, even weeks would pass without her crossing my mind. I met plenty of people in college and made tons of good friends, focused on my hobbies, it was the happiest I've been.	1
There is no fixing me I've come to realize, I just accept what is going to happen to me since I know I don't deserve to be happy.	1
Yes we have made love (3 times in 2017)   But it’s all me.	1
Now I finally know what The Script meant by “just praying to a god that I don’t believe in..”Slight ups and massive downs. I get these feelings where I'm able to do things while still having depression then I have these moments where all hits me. Not wanting to get out of bed feeling so negative. It's just something I wish I could just wake up from and realize it was all a dream.Why do I feel like I don't know myself anymore I keep struggling with depression and I feel like it's stripping away all the things that make me... me.  I used to be a good student, used to write stories about adventure and life, used to play sports, used to enjoy hanging out with friends and now I'm nothing.  I've been losing parts of myself until all that's left of me is misery.  All I feel like doing anymore is laying in my bed and staring at the ceiling or if I'm feeling particularly bad I cut myself.  What happened to me?  I try to be hopeful but... that gets exhaustingI need to sell/get rid of my gun I am realizing that the only reason I haven't killed myself is because my dog loves me. My first marriage ended over 7 years ago because my wife choose someone else over me. My fiance can create her own schedule, and she chooses to go in late so that she comes home after I go to sleep. My friends are having kids and families, and I have my little dog Dixie. She's amazing. I helped rescue her after her owner passed away and I could never do that to her again. She's 11 now and loves me. I read a story online about a dog passing away and I thought "if little Dixie goes, I'll go too." And it took hours before I realized that I don't think I'm kidding. I work only so that bills get paid. I'll never pay off my student loan debt. If I go soon, my nephew won't have any memories of me.	1
Do any males have experience with taking medicine and their effects?Frustration I don't understand why I'm depressed... I am pretty sure I am depressed, I don't feel much joy in life, I have trouble feeling enjoyment outside of compulsive/ harmful activites, I just feel numb, pointless. My thoughts turn to suicide quite often, but I would never do it.	1
Thanks for sticking around to the end of the post.Currently waiting at the hospital to be seen If I don't get treatment I am going to kill myself.  No one in my daily life cares. My sister and my mom didn't give a shit. My abusive boyfriend dumped me today and told me never to contact him again. I feel broken. I don't want to live in society anymore. I want to live in a hospital ward and not have to think. I don't want to live at all I can't study. Not even the thing i like the most I love history. I picked it this year and I can even take it as a hobby. I'm in contemporary history (my favorite period) and I have an exam on WWI and the USSR (it's a lot but that has never been a problem for me). But I can't study it.	1
I constantly wonder if there is a better, more fulfilling, and less depressing route to the other side of all of this.	1
We then decide to head to a bar (his decision, even though I told him I'm okay with going home), but we just drank our beers in silence, I tried telling him about a book I had just bought but I could tell he was disinterested. While on the way back home, I teared up while telling him that I've been trying so hard to communicate with him but I have just not gotten a response. He tells me that he's tired and it's got nothing to do with me. We head back home and I tell him to text me when he's back home but he doesn't. It's been 4 days since then and I texted him last night but to no response (it's been 24 hours).	1
I feel like I do nothing. Everyday is just nothing. In bed, video games, browsing internet, sex, video games, sad music and alcohol. Rinse and repeat. No joy. I want a social life and a hobby. I want a job. I want to not feel like im just laying down while everything falls apart on top of me.	1
Currently im numb because of anti depressants and possibly supressing so many thoughts in my young life.	1
But I think recently I have lost all my motivation for everything. There are days where I just want to play games and sleep all day because that probably is the only way to keep me bloody sane. Then there are days where I completely fine, but I don't think I have the same fire in me when I was younger.	1
I don't want to burden or blame anyone for what has happened but just I feel so abandoned.I wish no one knew me I'm already disappointing myself. No need to disappoint everyone else I feel like I'm not cut out to be an adult in this life. r/GetMotivated hardly helps me so I don't know why I still visit it. I always see some stupid bullshit like, "When life knocks you down, get up and knock it down harder" or whatever. I know it works for some people, but that stuff just makes me angry because it's *so* not me. I'm not a fighter. I don't understand how to just keep pushing and keep going on like that. I guess I've been doing that somewhat if I've made it to be 21 but I'm so fucking miserable. I don't understand how people get motivated and "just deal with it" and all that shit. And I know it's a meme to say that you're fine but don't want to get into because they wouldn't understand but it's so fucking true, and I know I'm just feeding into the cliches. Going back to the title, I think it's entirely likely I'm not meant to survive on this earth. In a universe that's so fucking vast, it makes too much sense for there to be the possibility that some humans just aren't meant to live like everyone else. Maybe I'm destined to kill myself. I'd rather not, I'd rather something else kill me so I *don't* have to deal with it.I appreciate you. Life is a strange place.  Full of misfortune, pain and suffering.   For whomever is reading this.  You don't deserve the pain and depression that you may have.  I don't know what you've experienced in you're life. I want to say I'm sorry for everything bad that's happened to you.  Everyone deserves to be loved and to be happy.	1
Should I stop trying to cope?	1
I have depression too, I'm very miserable and lonely, occasionally suicidal. Yet I am optimistic at heart, so feel free to PM me if you think a chat with me is what you need to feel a little better...Help me I want to be successful but i never have the will to be productive. I blame myself for that. As i should.	1
Or should I end it before long?	1
Here’s how we work: below you have the email address where you can find us. Please write us. In your first email, you can tell us anything you want, though a little bit of your story is always welcomed (though not required!). And that’s it!	1
I can't focus. It is so hard to focus on anything. I just stared at the blinking blue bar for 5 minutes just to type this unecessary sentence, because I lost whatever I wanted to write here in the maelstrom of thoughts inside my head.	1
Unrequited love is the worst. It consumes your mind almost every second of every day.	1
I spoke with kindness and compassion and love and respect for that child, and told him everything would be alright. I told him that all of that hatred was wrong, that it was incorrect and that those people who say all those nasty hurtful things, they probably aren't even going to remember saying it, so don't waste your time holding onto it.	1
When I first found out how it happened, I obsessed over articles that described the process they would have went through while dying. I kept wondering what they were feeling in that moment... if during those last moments they had regret. Then I kept tormenting myself with the “what if?”	1
You: hmm ok. would you rather have many friends or lots of money	1
I dont want anxiety and i dont want to be pathetic and i dont want to be scared and i dont want to be bored and i dont want people hate me and i want to know what to do	1
Have been friends with a woman for a few years.  Started off fun, we’d go for lunch, gigs and talk about a whole range of topics in person and by text.	0
Now.. I have no one to go to the party with LOL	0
All notifications on everything have been off for nearly a week, I don't get on discord anymore. I just feel so alone, so helpless, so very tired both physically and mentally.	1
**Goddamn Shit**	1
It's never enough. Not matter how much you work, how hard you try, it doesn't work. I don't get ahead. Everything I am, someone is better at it. And anything I do, I can be replaced. And if I do find success by some small measure, I acclimate and find myself just as miserable. Nothing has changed. I did a long big post a few weeks ago about all the supposed progress I made. It doesn't bring me happiness anymore. I am so fucking far behind I will never get to a place where I feel safe, so fuck it. I just want to exit. I am sick of being a cog in a machine I never wanted to help built or run. Life is just work, sleep, and distract.	1
I found myself laughing pretty hard at the irony of not getting a response from a suicide crisis hotline. Go figure.	1
After I found out I texted him letting him know that I found out about the cheating and that I lost all respect for him. He didn’t even bother responding or giving me a call. There was no text back, no phone call back. Zero conversation. I sent the text a week ago.	1
It sucks so bad that I genuinely think I will probably die prematurely and die lonely. I have no friends, no acquaintances, and just family that don't understand anything about what i'm going through. To be honest I wish I was never born. I wish i didn't exist because facing the world is killing me.	1
So here I am, if you guys know any sort of assassin hit me up, I might actually pay you to take me out. Save me the trouble of doing it myself.	1
After high school ended I spent a year and a half not really knowing what I was doing taking a class at my community college here and there but not really committing, while also changing my major at least twice. If I play my cards right I'll be able to graduate by he end of May in 2019 and hopefully transfer to a university. But recently I can't help but think of how my life would have been if I had just went straight to a university after high school. I don't have any friends right now and I feel that if I had gone to university out of high school I would have had friends at this point.	1
I feel bad for feeling this way. But it’s making me depressed. I don’t know how to go about this.Girlfriend on antidepressants no affection Hi everyone, my GF of 2 years has been on antidepressants for about 15 months, there is a definite lack of sex drive since then, but I understand that can be a side affect and she's acknowledged it and we've spoke about it. But sex itself is not really the issue. There is a distinct lack of affection. We never make out. Or really kiss unless I initiate it. Or hug much. It makes me feel shitty and lonely when I'm consistently the one pulling her in for a hug etc. I've spoken to her about it and she gets defensive and says she gives me plenty of affection and makes it seem like I've got a problem.	1
Subjecting people to isolation and distancing themselves from people as “different” due to “mental illness” and subjugating the “norm” from the “mentally ill” subjecting people to drug trials they have ended up in suicide and mass homocide, all for the progress of “psychiatric medicine”	1
So if 250 women viewed my profile, only one person tried to say something. Everyone else ignored me. 1/250. 249/250 women think I'm ugly or not worthy of a relationship. Think about that. That's how unwanted I am. What if every 3 minutes, someone told you "you're ugly, no one wants you, no one cares for you, and you will die forever alone"? That's the life I might as well live in. Let's not also forget the people that made fun of me too. I mean, what do you want me to do to get your replies, ladies? Do you want me to give you gold? Will that incentivize you to reply?	1
[17:31, 1/22/2018] Me: Anyways. Goodnight.	0
Edit: I didn’t expect so many people to care about me and it honestly made me feel a lot better about myself today. Thank you so much for all the wishes.Does everyone else just hurt all the time It’s not like physical pain or soreness, it’s just this overwhelming feeling of exhaustion and numbness. Doing anything, from applying for jobs to walking my dog, is just so overwhelmingly exhausting and it feels like running a marathon.	1
i wish i was prettier. i'm a guy but sometimes i wish i was a girl. i don't think its gender dysphoria, i just abhor my physical appearance. i can count on the fingers of one hand how many times ive looked into any kind of reflective surface.	1
I honestly think about taking my anti depressants again, just to get suicidal and off myself.	1
Sometimes I ask myself, why the hell do I even put up with all of this. The only reason why I haven‘t killed myself yet is because it‘d financially ruin my family.	1
I turned 17 a few months ago, and things have only gotten worse. My parents are completely delusional and can't grasp the fact that thet cause suffering for their own benefit. They would punch you in the face and find any excuse in the book to give a reason behind what they did, even if there wasn't one.	1
Forgive me for being skeptical about getting better when I've only seen my life decline since it began. I'm not even asking for pity, because I know it's just the luck of the draw and I was dealt a particularly shitty hand. But can you please understand that not all of us are going to be okay in the end? Just because you suffered for many years and I've suffered for many years and you no longer suffer like you used to, doesn't mean I'm not going to continue suffering as I always have been. Work I have a problem with always assuming everyone thinks Im terrible worker(well outside of work i just assume people think bad of me and i try so hard to prove im worthy). Im not a bad worker. Im an awesome worker. I do good work and never spend time on my phone or anything like that. But when im working on a job I feel as if my boss is watching me thinking to himself. "Fucking that guy needs to get a move on" or something like that. Im constantly asking my boss " So we have a good week? Anything you want to tell me" he says no but I still feel he talks shit in his mind or behind my back. Its alot of wasted stress I wish I could stop putting myself through. Thanks for reading. And i know its a me problem just need to vent. Thank you.Does anyone else's depression show itself as exhaustion? I find as I get older, that certain heavy type of exhaustion that can only be caused by depression gets more and more pervasive. As soon as things start going downhill, the unexplained tiredness hits and I become like a zombie. I have no energy to do my normal daily tasks, the thought of going through my evening routine before bed seems like climbing a fucking mountain; I barely have the energy to do anything other than sit on the couch and stare into space. The physical lethargy always comes hand-in-hand with the Brain Fog. Forget trying to study, forget going through the bills, my brain can't handle anything except moving my index finger to scroll down Reddit and watching cheap entertainment on youtube or Netflix.	1
I want to thank you all again. Not just for reading my story, but for being a part of this community. Depression and anxiety really suck, and nobody should have to suffer through them alone.	1

Any experiences of the antidepressants brintellix (Vortioxetine) for major depression? I’m so afraid of starting to take them, but i don’t want to feel this way of every morning waking up with no motivation for anything that the day brings me. stupid poetry Cast down, cast down.	1
Stranger: have you taken acid/shrooms before?	1
So you know to do this stuff. But of course, it's not going to magically feel 100% better right off the bat. There's still that emotional pain there, just like the way a skinned knee stings. But you've already done everything you can to take care of it, so you have to live with it and wait patiently for the pain to go away.	1
Leave me alone brain, I already know all that. I would be a king if I could. But I won't. Funny how despair can suck the marrow of your life, how even when you are ready to fall in the deepest pit, you have absolutely no will to catch the rope.	1
Depression is where you hurt, crawl on the floor crying, grabbing on to dear life alone in your dark room with your thoughts, too tired to do anything and then go to bed only to rise again to pretend that nothing happened.	1
I read it has something to do with the brain not wanting to change all the time. Going places etc. Plus health, security etc. So it makes sense my brain is telling me not to go places.	1
Been depressed arguably since I was 15 (25 now). Looking back on my childhood, I can definitely see some signs of childhood depression. The past year has been particularly bad in terms of my mental health.	1
After all the years my Father gets his life back under control. He begins dating a wealthy woman who isn't a fan of me. He takes prolonged stays at her home about 40 miles away. He would visit the house to restock it with food, pay the bills, then leave again. During this time i saw my Father maybe 15 times a year. Each encounter was brief and lasted less than 30 minutes.	1
I endure myself."Dead Mom, Schizophrenic Father. I wrote a 1,900 page message but I figured no one would read it. My mother committed suicide because I left home after years of neglect and emotional abuse. I couldn’t go to my father because he has severe schizophrenia and it’s not safe to be around him. I moved across country after my sister who had left a year prior convinced me to do. After I moved across country my sister gave me 2 weeks to get an apartment or she’d kick me out. I got a job and an apartment (with the help of a really shitty roommate) and I had been working practically trying to just ignoring my previous life. A week ago I found out my mother had killed herself and now me and my sister are back to our old home trying to fix all the problems created by her unexpected (I honestly expected it) death. I’ve left all details out because I could fill a fucking book with them but the main point of this post is, I’ve been fighting all my life for a better life but things always seem to get worse and worse. I’m at the point where I feel like joining my mother. You can only fight for so long before you’ve run out of energy.Little sister has depression, what do I do? As the title says my baby sister has depression and I heard from my boyfriend this subreddit gives him support. I just discover the past summer that my little sister (14) has depression and is now cutting her self with razor blades. I warned my mother that I read her diary and she was counting calories first in September. Earlier this week I told her to keep an eye on her cause I think she is depressed, btw I live in another continent at home and thus have limited access on how much I see them. My mom said she will keep an eye to see if she is cutting herself or not. We recently discovered that she does in deed and her circle of friends have depression too. She is being bullied as well by one guy at school and confidant has depression and is cutting himself as well.	1
Mom said to get a roast beef out of the freezer and cook it with some potatoes and carrots and stop thinking about negative things. I went to Landmark and they say this is all just a story, and part of a racket I created to avoid responsibility. They say I can create something different by changing my story.	1
Now I’m ruined. I’m broken. The guilt eats away at me all the time, constantly. As soon as I think of my family that’s all I can think of. Apparently I was found in a aggravated state, and upon being discovered I punched two holes in the wall, along with attempting to put in a hole in my father’s head. God I fucking hate myself. I’m not even a violent person, I hate hurting anything. Being anywhere around my home or family just makes me unbearably sad now. I had to come home and look my brother in the eye, and apologize for being so fucked up I tried to not only punch my dad, but a police officer who was forced to restrain me. By the way I don’t remember any of this, all of this my parents told me. You know how much that hurts? Not remembering a night at all, and it turns out you ran at your dad screaming, “fuck you I’m gonna kill you”	1
She returns and we spend one night together and she calls me at school to come over to her place asap. she dumps me with little to no explanation. I met with her once more to voice my opinion and she was just quiet and had nothing to say but sorry and that i deserve someone who loves me like Love her. Today she starts emailing me about how she just needs space and she wants me to still talk to her family.	1
But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but it doesn't really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along. Something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved.	1
It’s so hard to be happy and I’m just... I’m starting to give up.Does anyone talk to themselves? I do all the time. I’m trying to stop.My Life = Depressed Cycle HELL I have been depressed since my early teens. 18 now. In last year of high school but my grades are horrible, Im MISERABLE at my job but cant quit due to the pay, I completely lack a social life and girlfriend, and have so little motovation I feel like I will flunk out of college if I go. I was going to go to talk to my psychiatrist that does medication management for ADD when I went to see her the other day. I literally couldnt suck up the pride to tell her I was depressed and need a psychologist referal. She even asked how my moods were and I said they were just fine. I feel weird just meeting a random psychologist and dont know how to find a good one. Being a guy I have just sucked it up for the last 5 year and I feel weak for needing help, and even with me telling myself I need help I keep thinking every psychologist listing i see isnt good enough and keep pushing it off like I have for a LONG time.	1
Please try watching The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross It may not have the same effect on you as it does me, hence why I say "please try". That show calms me, makes me feel better, and helps me sleep. Bob Ross has a soothing voice and I love his mindset. You can watch the entirety of the show on the official Bob Ross YouTube channel.My latest depression has a cure, and it's my girlfriend. So this is my story about a severe depression and anxiety I have been experiencing these months. TLDR, we kinda broke up back in April, we had some issues regarding me being a prick. But, she forgave me as we have a perfect relationship (that's right, I do think it's marvelous). But for some important reason that I don't wanna give details in, we can't be together anymore. So, I started having anxiety attacks, and all my world was like hell, it was so bad, I felt like I had to do something about it. Anyways, I am fighting to be back again with her, and she also is waiting for me. We all dream about things or situations where we would allegedly be happy with: money, being successful.. all that kind of stuff. Here's what I have learned: When I dream about all this stuff, at the end the only thing, I mean, my only desire, the only thing that I crave in this world, and which I would be crushed to not have, is her. I'm a person who deeply depends on others, I previously gave myself into deep friendships, but after all, and after all experience, my only friendship and relationship I'm keeping with is my girlfriend. She literally is my everything regarding my happiness, and me being alive.	1
Stranger: true	1
Sure we are all still friends but I feel like i'm being slowly excluded. Is this just me? What do you all think?Are you concerned about distracted driving?

I hate forcing myself to do the most simple things, like: taking a shower, putting on makeup, cooking, cleaning, even playing videogames. I'm a huge WoW nerd, so I should be excited for the new patch and game. But, I'm not. I got amped up when I saw the trailer, but now, I rather not play it. I rather not play anything. Just recently, I forced myself to play Bioshock again. It's been years since I visited Rapture. I *love* Rapture. But why is it so boring to play? I used to have so much fun...	1
The next day she was at my school ready to pick me up. She had flown on the next available flight to get to me. When I returned home, I went through months of therapy and psychiatry and yoga and meditation all arranged all by my mom. In the beginning, I was okay. Broken down and exhausted but seemingly on the mend. On some level, I was relieved that I had finally been diagnosed with something (went from depression to bipolar II to a depressive mood disorder). I worked really hard with my therapist to understand my guilt, disgust and trauma, which ironically had been entirely driven by ways I tried to cope with my depression. However, fully expecting to go back to college for the next semester, I was informed that I was not allowed to return yet. When I chose to leave in the middle of the semester, the dean didn't share the information that they had never let a student return from health leave until after six months of treatment. I had withdrawn from all my classes and sacrificed a semester's worth of my parents money thinking that I would be returning shortly and only a semester behind.	1
Stranger: i had to quit smoking weed for a drug test	1
Everyone always has their golden fix for me too. My mom tells me to drink lemon water. My dad says “stop worrying so much.” My coworker says “meditate.” Exercise. Volunteer. Quit your job and go do what you love (which is what, exactly?).	1
Maybe I am too cynical or something. But this bad world syndrome fucks my brain and idk. I REEEEALLLLY question every aspect of life and I can't help it. Each time I am left with questions that completely make me hate the way this world is. I guess I can give one example. The most recent self-philosophical argument I had is the idea of wars, with murdering others specifically. We praise those who fight for our country, yet at the same time a great deal of these same people are super religious. Do people not evaluate the reality they are in? Do they not question why they believe the things they do? Am I the only one? Does someone's act of ending another life provide justification for doing the same? Who is to even say so? If they would kill all of us if we did not kill them, then what makes our lives worth more?	1
No relationships (no potential of attaining)	1
My friends are sporadic.	1
While going back over these posts from so relatively long ago, I noticed that most of the older ones seemed like they were written by a total stranger. If it were somebody else saying those things about me, it would be called harassment, but it was me saying those things about myself.  All in all, this has really made me realize that all the things I have written about myself are way off-base, and are only true in my mind during a depressive episode.	1
Half of me finds it genuinely funny that A. I deserve a future. B. I won’t kill myself in the next 3 months.	1
Now I'm missing half the lectures, sometimes I don't even go to the shops to get food for the day and have a terrible diet, miss enormous amounts of sleep, and haven't done any work at all. I'm already failing, and even with resits I have to get a ridiculous mark on my tests this semester to even stand a chance of a worthy final score after the 3rd year is over. I feel like the only thing that's gonna bring me out of the depression is the pride of getting a good grade, but I'm way too pessimistic right now to believe that deep down I can even do it.	1
I watched a video of her earlier. Happy and giddy with excitement. She jumped around and kicked her legs, unable to contain her excitement. She was so happy and full of enjoyment.	1
and she has bearly talked to me once.	1
I'm convinced that only 2 friends like me, 1 pities me, and their friends just mock me stealthily. Paid for societies but don't go to any. Feel like a huge disappointment to my family tbh. Life for me is gonna fall apart and it'll be the end of me (this is my first post and I'm on mobile so sorry if the formatting is off)	1
When I went to college, my roommate and I became best friends but a year later, he decided to drop out and leave. I realize this is through no fault of my own but it still sucks losing a best friend.	1
I'm trying so hard to do things I wouldn't recommend to do to anyone who cherishes their mental state, but we are all forced to take part in this stupid "just be happy, smile, reach out, you are worth it, etc" game. Bullshit, euphemisms, THIS IS PURE HUMILATION AND TORTURE; on my terms I wouldn't even ask you how to get to a transport if i got lost in a demons-populated forest.	1
Every second a man falls down. Every second someone drowns. Every second a bullet to the head, leaves someone lying dead. All you see is one small frown. In this little shitty ghost town.	1

I just don't care.I give up trying, eat healthy, exercises blah fucking blah what’s the point when I still fucking wake up wanting to die and cry myself to sleep every night? Just lost all hope, I think some people are made for this life and others are just not and I’m one of those people. When will the day come I don’t imagine suicide or my own funeral? It’s been non stop hell for 5 years and I don’t see it ever getting better. I hope for the rest of you it does I really do but for me I’ve just given up I’ve ran out of hope.Anyone wanna just distract each other from depression for a few minutes with a good convo? I’m 20f. I am so bored. I have absolutely nothing to do. I’ve been so depressed lately that I’ve pushed everyone away. Everyone’s asleep right now anyways and I’ll probably be up all night again... so, if anyone wants to talk all night, I’m perfectly fine with that! Two things kept me alive today Firstly, I have not yet hiked across Iceland.	1
But she couldn’t wait. I don’t blame her, she’s discovering herself. She’s beautiful. I never had a chance. There are better men for her. I’m broken, the pieces stomped on.	1

Same with my other habits, I eat like once in a day, which is an obligation I have put on myself to do at least once. Even then its very less than what any normal person of my age eats. I barely get 4-6 hours of sleep due to my schedule and not able to sleep quickly at night.	1
My life is a mess. My head is a mess.	1
My Brothers wife left him shortly after I moved in. He became suicidal as well, ended up hospitalized. I moved back across the country again to live with my then pseudo homeless Father.	1
The funny thing (say my brain) is this : "you are a loser, you lived and worked on your own not so long ago. But you are a child, you have the power to do what you want, where you want. You're 25, for God's sake, so why don't you move your ass ?"	1
Idk what I’m going to do but these are my thoughts that I can’t contain at the moment. Advice on where to post for advice on taking antidepressants. Hi, UK based poster - I've recently taken my Doctors advice and got a prescription for antidepressants. I've been in-and-out of various states of mild to severe depression throughout my teens &amp; twenties, but I've always figured this is just something everyone has to deal with at some stage or another, so I've never sought help even when falling off a proverbial cliff edge. After much deliberation, someone I care deeply about got me to try counselling, but I find that I'm really not getting much out of it right now, as I don't have the will to try, and my focus is all over the place (I'm being tested for ADHD too, but I'm still awaiting the results). My Doctor suggested trying a combination of antidepressants and CBT (the latter of which I am currently attempting to source a support group for), however I have an underlying phobia of long-term medication after seeing several people close to me, use it as a crutch and just become something wholly unfamiliar to me as a result. I've been prescribed Citalopram (Celexa for those stateside) but like I said - I have deep-seated reservations about taking them and before I tried, I wanted to see if there was anywhere/anyone I could talk to about their experiences on the drug and any perhaps any suggestions they could offer about managing short-term (6-9 months) antidepressant medication? I've looked at the sub-reddit rules for this group and I'm not sure if this crosses rule 3; if so, can someone help me find the right place to ask my question(s)?I sob thinking about my painfully wasted young years I'm going to write this hopefully without stopping to think myself into madness with corrections and such. Too late I just backspaced two whole sentences! There is this big fucking hard block of concrete in my head that stops me from doing anything including things I like such as drawing and reading. I love going on tumblr and pinterest and deviantart to look at the amazing drawings and paintings people are able to create. Sometimes though, I get really jealous of the fictional characters in the fandoms. Heck, I get really jealous of people in my life and around the world; young people. I just get this sinking, dreadful feeling inside my chest realizing that I'm wasting my young years doing nothing. I'm 24 now, and looking back on my life I've just been a sad, pathetic underachiever with no drive or history of doing anything adventurous. I'm wasting my young years. I'm wasting my young years. It plays over in my head all the time. I can't get my brain to shut off. Every night before I go to bed it plays over and over. I'm just so sad and disappointed in my life and how I've done nothing with it. Even as a little kid I never did anything fun and I don't have any wild stories of adventure, excitement, nor things like "Lol we were dumb kids yada yada...We did this all the time yada yada..." I'm sorry for the rant. Writing it out didn't help me get the chants out of my head. I'm so sad guys. And I know that fictional characters are deliberately made to be fascinating and have amazing lives, but there are people who were born 5 years before me (who are real, yes) and they are really living their lives to the fullest and are doing amazing things. Right now I want to go out, rent a solid 4x4, and drive to some god knows where designated dark space and lay on my back and gaze at the stars in the night sky. I want to go do something fun and amazing, but knowing I've wasted so many years being depressed in bed, on my computer, sleeping, and just doing nothing will haunt me forever.	1
These days I feel exactly like I am slogging through those low energy periods again. My mind would never shut down at my usual bedtime and at times anxiety would keep me awake until 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning. My biological clock is a total mess, in the morning I would just sleep in and refuse to wake up, even though it's already past noon. I tend to shy away from as much social interaction as possible; I just plainly don't want to meet anyone, it freaks me out and makes me uncomfortable. I even refuse to answer any emails or continue the dreary job searching and job application.	1
You: yes and lonely and insecure	1
Working 9-5 ain't no way to make a living. So ignoring the pun, I seriously have no interests in what carreer I want when I'm older (im 17, kicked out of collage) I don't know if this is he depression but after working overtime on my shitty Saturday job I have had 5days work in a row and without sounding like a lazy cunt who has never worked. I genuinely have never been so fucking depressed, all I have done is wake up at 8. Work all day, not said a word to anyone been depressed all day, got in, all my mates are out enjoying summer and don't speak to me or anything. I usually get in at about 6pm I eat tea then shower then do nothing for a few hours until I go to bed and repeat. Without sounding too dramatic, I can't do this for the rest of my life. I don't want to work. I know you have to but why? I don't want to do something I don't want to do, I don't understand why the world is this way and it makes me super fucking depressed. I have no hobbies and I just feel like pure shit.Sometimes I regret not killing myself Life if so pointless..No matter what I do I’m always gonna be sad. My life is going no where.I don't have the motivation for anything anymore. I just don't. Not even for the things that i love.	1
I had a plan in place to hang myself but my friends at the time took the rope I was going to use and I was too broke to buy another.	1
As you’ve been told, you are luminous. You shine bright. Your heart is [almost too] huge. You have the potential to do great things. You are not your illness and you are not your insecurities. The grave you will lay in one day will only consist of you and nobody else. If the world ends and you survive, you have yourself. You have to keep this mind every single day. Work on self love and understand your worth. Yes, G makes you feel like the most important girl in the world. But before you can let him do that, you need to understand that you are the most important girl in the world to yourself, for yourself.	1
Then there is her and her boyfriend. There is a whole thing about her and her psycho ex who even though made her feel afraid for her life, she still loves and talks to. WHILE WITH HER BOYFRIEND. I don't think she cheats on her boyfriend but I don't understand that whole deal that seems like an issue for another reddit thread all together. But yeh she does brag about how much sex she has with her boyfriend and how much they love each other. Which brings me to this next issue that I couldn't even wrap my head around.	0
Funny thatLife is such a burden for those who are broken It sucks knowing you're cursed to have to try to become a fundamentally different person I'm tired, I need someone to tell me I'm okay. I can't tell what's wrong with me, I just feel moody for the past 7 days. Even though school just restarted and I should be high on my spirits.	1
I know I need to open up and talk through any issue that may come up but in the back of my head there's a voice telling me that if I do, it will only make it worse. And the fucked up thing about it is that the voice is right 90% of the time because most people in my life don't percieve the things that bother me as actual issues. Fuck everything about communication, it only makes things worse. I honestly don't need anything else adding to the massive weight I bear.I noticed people who talk to me, sometimes just walk away mid conversation I'm socially awkward and I have a hard time reading cues about where the person wants to take the conversation. Is he genuine with me right now, am I interesting enough? I end up expressing myself in bizarre ways and people just up and leave. I find it incredibly rude almost like I'm a crazy person and they think it's okay to disrespect me. It hurts a lotDifference between antidepressent starting side-effects and hypomania? Hey all,	1
I’ll never be enough. Ever. For anyone. I just want to ducking die.The only time I can enjoy my life is when I'm watching anime/listening to music Every time I put on those headphones that allow me to leave this miserable reality, I feel alive. Any other time I feel like I'm just lifelessly struggling to deal with my responsibilities. That's why I listen to music all the time. That's why I only get excited when watching anime. I need fiction to get me through a day or else I go completely numb.	1
Because my whole life has been focused on success, I attempted suicide a few times when I found out I was illegal and couldn't even go to college in high school. Obviously they all failed. However in 2012, the year before I graduated, Obama passed daca. Because I had been here since I was a toddler, was going to finish school, and didn't have even a single misdemeanor, I was able to get a social security number, a work permit, a driver's license, open investment accounts, and received protection from deportation.	1
I'm losing touch with reality. I have loving parents but their advice isn't particularly helpful. What I want is a friend, someone to talk to--but the anxiety gets in the way. I can talk to people in a structured setting, like therapy, or online (and easily and freely at that). But it's the act of doing it in the real world, in a natural setting, that is just impossible.	1
Can we actually talk about one of my female friends a bit more, actually? We'll call her M and my other female friend B. We met M last year and we invited her to hang out with us during our lunches. M was going through a tough time and we helped her out all the time and it was great making a new really close friend. She was really fun to talk to, but I don't know...sometimes she says some shit to me that makes me kinda bummed. I remember telling her how I felt kinda depressed once, and she said something along the lines of "Stop asking for attention and actually do something". Another time, I was hanging out with B's boyfriend, but the next day, M was mad at me and told me I shouldn't take him from B (which I do get and feel bad for, but B is totally cool with it and understands how me and her boyfriend hang out :p) Recently, (I don't remember what initiated the conversation really) M and I were talking (which rarely happens anymore), and she was talking about how she feels like she doesn't have anyone that actually cares for her, when she has so many people that clearly do care about her and love her. Then she proceeds to tell me to actually go and make friends again. I hate being petty and talking about other people, but I just don't feel comfortable being very close to her anymore and I'm not sure she's interested in talking to me either.	1
I guess I'm just reaching out to anyone else in a similar position. **It's ok not to be ok.**	1
I used to be smart, or atleast feel smart. Lately I feel like I've dumbed down. Questions that I used to answer easily became hard for me. English, something I was proud of for learning it by myself, became harder for me. My memory isn't what it used to be.	1
Eventually, we got tired of fighting and I realized what it was that I fucked up: an extremely good friendship. After I made an effort to show how sorry I was, she made an effort to let me back into her life. Then I thought, "Don't fuck this up. She doesn't need you to like her. She needs you to be a good friend." I said some harsh things, and because of it, we weren't friends for 2 to 3 years. So naturally, we tried making up for the time we had lost.	1
What if they are wrong?	1
I'm sorry if this is long or it just sounds like i'm complaining. I just wanted other peoples opinions on this as I just don't know what to think. I messed up... I'm not gonna beat around the bush. I tried to kill myself. I freaked out at the last minute and stopped the worst of the bleeding but now I have a huge, bloody gash on my wrist. I don't want anybody to find out but I won't be able to hide it for long. It's bleeding all over the palce and the most I have to cover it is shitty plasters. What the fuck am I supposed to do now???I dont wanna be here. No one cares and no one is here for me i dont want to live anymore Post workout depression I have noticed lately that after a good workout the rest of the night i feel really great but the next day I'm more depressed than normal. Has anyone experienced thisI’m quite literally dead inside Even when I feel emotions, it’s just despair and sadness. The rest of it just pure numbness. I can’t remember half the thing I was doing today and I don’t even care. The only thing keeping me alive is video games and the hope of some new bond in the next school year. Eventually, it won’t be enough. I’ve always felt broken inside. Ever since 6th grade. But there. Just needed some of that off my chest. Sorry for bitching and wasting your time.Tomorrow is my birthday and I really don't give a shit I really dont like my birthday because the past 5 years have been so horrible for me. Every year on my birthday I just think about how hard everything has been and how unhappy I am, hoping I'll be happier the next year. But then I get to the next birthday and just realize that I'm still so unhappy and unsatisfied with life. I'm just getting tired of it. I hate hearing people wish me a happy birthday when me being happy on my birthday just seems impossible. I wish I was bad at faking it Everyone thinks I'm better, that I just have trouble sleeping sometimes and college is tough the first semester blah blah. And I want to be perfect for my boyfriend and make him happy and act like this cute little girlfriend for him. But he always believes my fake smiles and my fake "I'm fine!", I wish he could tell because I don't want to tell him when I'm struggling. And at the sametime I want to tell him I think about killing myself often and I need him sometimes, but I don't want to force him to comfort me and be there for me.Does anyone else go way out of their way for others, because no one goes out of their way for you? I have two roommates who are in a relationship together. I moved out of my parents house to live with them. I am on my own for the first time in my life. I have no one who cares about me anymore.	1
Thing is, it's getting more and more difficult to talk with her as it seems as though *ANYTHING* sets her off these days!  And while I've nothing at all against Bill Burr - I actually think he's hilarous! - talking to her is like trying to talk back to one of his on-stage rants, understand?!  Because he's ranting to be funny, but she actually means what she says.	0
That you are,	1
When my turn came I basically said:	1
Right now I'm just gathering the courage to tell my parents, I know it has to be today. Anyone else in a similar situation? Any thoughts or advice? The time is ticking ..... "It's just a matter of time"  ( well everything is a matter of time really )	1
That was the final straw for me, I think. I feel like a shell of who I was before December 31st. I am terrified of the future. I remember when my friend died, I asked myself who I would lose next. I had no idea things would spiral down and down.	1
Kind of a long read :/   Hi to all those that like reading long posts from internet randoms 👋 i post about my ex but no one cares to help or give me advice so i need someone to listen to me pleaseImagine being attractive Imagine what it would be like to be desired, to have someone look at you not in disgust or ambivalence. It's all just a roll of the dice, It's too bad if you roll poorly you will be treated objectively worse.	1
But what's the worst part? That you can't control it? That you can't stop it? Maybe it's the fact that just maybe... just maybe you don't want It to stop.	1
Im feeling that everything is worse. My job sucks but I have to keep it as I got to keep up with school costs. Already got pretty hefty debt from those two halve years of university. I just feel that everything that I do fails. Like the last 2 years I've accomplished nothing. I would like to travel if I'm going to have my second gap year but my funds wouldnt allow it. Working would be my only option but the only jobs that are available will push me over the edge. But there is something good at the horizon; there is a small chance I'm getting accepted in to the police academy, but that's only a small chance so no big hopes as that makes it worse.say what You know what? THIS IS FUCKING RIDICOLOUS. I got rejected from yet another interview, although I hate any kind of job - it's all stupid as hell, fuck wageslavery, fuck every company, fuck everyone who plays this psychotic game, and thinks it's what normal people do. Why was I born in a third-world country that won't pay shit for people with severe anxiety like I have. I SIMPLY CAN'T INTERACT WITH PEOPLE, It's not my fault I don't have anything in common with narcisstic crazyass bastards like you.	1
I sat down with my manager this morning and explained it all.  The crying in the bathroom, the calling in sick because I'm too scared to go in, everything. She was really nice about it, and I decided to put in my notice.	1
I've been conditioned to believe these things since I started college and I feel stuck. I'm trying to deny that I believe in these things, but the thoughts keep coming back.	1
My day hasn't been great but soon bed time to start again tomorrow. Does anyone else "live inside their head"? Hi, this is my first ever post.	1
A time machine would also buy happiness.  If one existed, again: money.Becoming fat Perhaps due to my meds (some of them have side effects pertaining to increase in appetite and weight gain), and perhaps due to my ridiculous comfort eating, I have become fat. Which is very obvious because I am short and have a small frame. Plus all my tailor made clothes don’t fit me.	1
She said if I ever do anything like that again she'll ruin my therapists life. I feel as though she is basically at this point a bomb waiting to go off. She then asked me how my rabbit is doing??? Like I want to speak to her now???	0
I feel better than I have in a long time, but I’m not there yet and I’m still struggling to address the root of my depression, so yeah I still look awful.	1
Hoping I can work up the courage to kill myself by the end of today. I'm really scared to do it but its something I really need to do for my own sake.Am i simply lazy or is there something more? If this doesn't fit this sub please delete.	1
Im done, its overIt's hard staying alive for a future you have no faith in I have no desire to go to college, I have no desire to get a good job, I don't want a family, i just want to die, it's hard staying alive for a future you have no faith inI’ve lost all my real life friends and all most of my online friends due to depression and i honestly don’t know if it’s even worth it anymore. I’ve lost my real life friends due to moving and changing schools and just not talking to any of them anymore because i just can’t. Online friends are gone because i’m too much of a burden to everyone and they just eventually leave me. Only person i can call friend is another person i’ve known for 2 years off of Borderlands 2 and he’s going through the exact same thing. Im so fucking lonely and just tired of not having energy to make new ones. I hate life	1
Mental illness is just poisoning every aspect of my world and I can't be fucked to fight it i just wish I could live more on my own terms but apparently that's selfish and naiveMy dad died today So I’m 16, coming on 17 next month.	1
I know I’m a decent disappointment to both of them for several reasons.	1
I've tried every trick in the book to stop procrastinating but nothing works. Anyone else deal with this?I feel so lost Hi. I'm 15 year old girl from India and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. Everybody is passionate about something right? I'm not. I don't ever remember the last time in my life I was genuinely excited about anything. What makes everything worse is that in 1 month, I have to decide what I'm going to do with my life. Here in India, we don't get to pick our classes individually. In junior and senior year, you pick what stream you want (Commerce, Humanities, Medical or Engineering). The first two bore the hell out of me. I'd like to do Medical but I don't think I can study for another ~10 years after high school. I'm good at the Engineering subjects (Physics, Chemistry and Math) and I like CS but I've never really enjoyed doing it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bad at studying. I'm among the top kids at my school. Everybody thinks I have my life figured out and somehow that just makes it worse. I'm fucking terrified of what the future holds. I stay up whole nights crying just going over what is going to happen and trying to achieve some sort of clarity about what I'm going to do. I have tons of friends at school but I've never connected with anyone. There was this one guy I was really good friends with and had a crush on since 6th grade but he changed schools last year and we lost touch. I've tried making actual new friends since then but it's never clicked with anyone. There are good days and bad days, the latter consisting of me drawing all the curtains in my room, turning off the lights, wrapping myself in my blanket and just laying there in the dark. It embarrasses me to admit that that is what I'm doing right now. I really want to go to college in the US just to experience something new for once but med school is really expensive. I just want to feel happy about something for once. Why does nothing interest me anymore? I feel like a robot going through the same routine everyday. Eat, study, sleep, repeat.	1
Right after high school I didn't really have any second thoughts and what I was doing. I was fine with going to community college and transferring later on but right now I can't help but feel that I've made a huge mistake. If only I had done better in freshmen year I probably would have gotten accepted into university and had a completely different life. I'm only 21 and I already feel like a huge goddamn retard for how I acted in my high school life. If i had taken things more seriously my life right now would have been a lot better.	1
Historically, preparing a meal and feeding someone is a virtuous act, at least to me. The commoditization of it is a bit of a shame.	1
While trying to improvie myself and during my studies and time at the Army I still had periods where I felt very down. It just becomes harder and harder and harder to crawl out of it every time. The negative voices and feelings are too much and getting up to fight just becomes impossible.	1
And that's when the Aha! moment came.	1
Me: "I'm going to sleep all day and keep coming to reddit and message other people with un-treated broken arms!"	1
Telling people they can’t overcome their problems with life due to their bad brain which doesn’t operate correctly and the only thing they can do is take a psychiatric drug?	1
She eventually leaves my car saying that I should come sleep in her house and that “everything will be fine”. Right now it’s 2am and I’m still in my car and I’m so fucking mentally fucked up I don’t know what to do.I'm such a fucking loser I can't even socialize ppl must assume I'm a fucking weirdo when I actually try to I'm just a depressed fuck and I hate myself so fucking much I wish I could show ppl how much I dodoes it ever feel like your friends arent really there? I genuinely care for and love my friends so I regularly ask them how they're doing on messenger since they all live so far away. I know my friends struggle with depression so I make it a point to contact them and let them know I'm here for them. But most times I am left on "read" or get lukewarm responses, as though they are annoyed. They don't really initiate conversation with me and rarely ask me how I'm doing. I hope I don't sound selfish in any way, but it just feels weird to care so much for people who don't seem to care that much for you. It hurts sometimes that I also struggle with depression but have no one to talk to..Today is my 45th birthday. Today is my 45th birthday. Being 45 doesn't bug me as much as the lack of accomplishments and life lived in those years. I've spent the last 20 years lost in depression. I'm tired, hopeless, ashamed, and emotionally defeated. I go to bed scared and wake up disappointed. People ask if I am suicidal, and my answer is, "I'm open to the possibility." People ask if I'm planning, and I say, "No, not actively. I've already planned it out." I can't understand why I am still here nor do I understand why I stay.	1
Earlier today, during our school's lunch break, I opened up to somebody I trusted about my depression and anxiety. I've been on a steep downward spiral recently, and this person had taken notice that something was wrong. She sat me down, grabbed us a couple of sodas, and told me to spill my guts. Normally, I would have simply told her that everything was fine, and made some lame excuse like "I didn't sleep well last night" or "I'm just worried about my exam scores". But this was the first time that anybody had ever reached out to try and help, so I decided to be truthful. I thanked her for offering to listen, and explained that I had never shared this with anybody else, so I might struggle to fully express myself. She was understanding, and told me to take as much time as I needed.	1
i'm trying to wait for health insurance to kick in from my fast food job. i hate this job. i like my co-workers, even though they think i'm weird. i'm trying so hard to get them to like me. i just want people to like me. people always said i was weird and made fun of me. i mean, thats like anyone else, i guess.	1
" good days will come " ( but they never stay )	1
The problem is that no one knows when I’m telling the truth. I’ll try to come out to people. I’ll try to tell them about my drug abuse. I’ll try to tell them about who I am.	1
Hi everyone,	1
Stranger: but slightly coping i guess	1
I don’t want to die. I don’t want to be alive. I simply don’t want to.	1
You: nice, u trust people?	1
I wish we could both forget and not know each other I think she'd be a lot happier she used to say she was happy she knew me but now knowing me makes her absolutely miserable and I think she'd be a lot happier overall if she never did.	1
I'm not sure what happened, but I started losing my drive. Things didn't look as exciting, nor entertaining. Never having even kissed a girl, I felt alone and loveless. Still, I felt motivated enough to start working on my social skills, met a few people over the Internet, even got a girlfriend. (Thanks to the Internet I have a social life, as ironic as that sounds, even though it's not that good).	1
I'm constantly 'zoning out'. It's got to the point where I sometimes forget what happened 30 seconds ago. I'll be in shower and zone out for 30 seconds, come back and I can't remember if I washed my hair or not. It's always simple things like that. I still have no problem with studies, remembering appointments and generally anything that matters. Yet, I still check if I closed the fridge door 3 times within a few minutes...	1
So, after a string of breakups, moving too slow and moving too fast, as well as her cheating on my several times, she finally called it quits one week after my birthday (November just gone). I had no say, because she'd throw a tantrum, but I had to take the initiative.	1
Last November, my brother did sth bad. And my ex attempted suicide. That is when i got depressed again. The first time in 2 years	1
I keep trying to keep going, but I want to give up. I want to feel nothing. I don’t want to cry anymore.	1
Edit: been at work all day then went to visit a former Marine that dealt with some serious issues in his day but is doing well now. Mulled over a lot of this with him, then checked back in here and saw all these wonderful responses.	1
Other reasons why I think he may be depressed are:- A week before he came home, he found out his dog of 13 years passed away.	1
of course, you know all this, because you like to stop by every couple weeks and make sure of it. i think you’re more regular than my time of the month (which would probably be more regular if i could just stick to taking my birth control every day, but we already established that i suck at taking pills that i’m supposed to).	1
My family has never been super close. We get along with each other and talk to each other but we're not a support system and I don't feel comfortable talking to them about my problems. I feel like I'll be judged and gossiped about so I just keep it to myself and as a result wind up pushing them all away.	1
At the same time, I have conflicting feelings over my loneliness. I desire human interaction, but others find me rigid and distant. In all honesty, I'm easily bored by small talk and trivial discussions. I understand that it's important in forming friendships, but my under-stimulated brain seems to automatically 'shut-off' after a while.	1
I'm just lost. I've never been so alone in my life and its terrifying me My girl broke up with me by text, and wont return my texts. Saw her at uni today and had a panic attack. All my housemates are away. My parents talk to me once a week. I have no friends. No one to talk to. No where to go. I cant stop crying and the thoughts are back telling me to end it all. I dont know what to do. This is probably more of an /r/offmychest post but I dont know how to keep going. I love her. And she doesnt care about me. No one does. Life huh some people are born without any luck , here is proof :	1
I'm sorry if this seemed really petty and like I'm just bitching about some shitty first world problems, because I know I am. :/ I just feel kinda down right now and I haven't been able to tell someone how I actually feel in months.	1
As I got older, when I would replicate doing the same thing when I had nightmares, I would get scolded instead. That's how the bed was - just enough for 2 adults and 1 kid-sized human, I guess?	0
I wish I could tell you I'm sorry. But it wouldn't change anything. For you it's a battle that was fought long ago. For me, I relive it more times than I'd care to admit.	1
I have no friends or anybody to talk to. I realize this isn't a healthy lifestyle, and that I'm a loser. But I want to change. How do I meet people and make friends? When I meet people, what do I talk about? Desperate for advice or input; I lost and am losing everything held dear to me right now due to multiple reasons, and would just like to hear some different recommendations I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I DONT KNOW WHERE I WENT WRONG OR HOW TO FEEL BETTER!!	1
(I can't believe I just told all my students about my mental illness, but it honestly feels so liberating to do so. It also feels so hypocritical of me to send this, because I attribute much of my self-worth to academics and don't practice much self-care.....but I felt like this needed to be said).	1
Stranger: suicide is kinda pointless	1
Do you think I wanted/want to be this sad excuse of a human being ?!	1
I keep going back to thoughts that Im useless... That no one cares... That my life has been ruined because im now perminantly disabled...im constantly in pain and sometimes it's so bad injust want to kill myself to escape it... I have no insurance and no job and most of the doctors ive seen dont care.... I want so despirately for someone to help me... I want to get better and have ANY portion of my life back so I can just fo back to my normal level of manageable anguish I was at before....  Because I cant work anymore I feel like a burden... I moved out of my parents house and in with my boyfriend, and now fully rely on him and my parents to support me financially... I feel like im making everyones lives harder.... I feel like all I do is get in the way... I cant even keep up with housework properly.... I push myself to the point that my back is killing me because I dont want to accept i cant do things anymore.... And then i end up in bed for long periods of time... Wallowing in my own sadness and wondering why the fuck I even bothered in the first place.... I feel like im stuck in this endless loop of "try to get on my feet. Fall.try again. Panic. Try again. Left out. try again. Fall again" i feel like i have no control over any of the things happening in my life.... Its like they are just happening to me and i just have to accept it.. I'm killing myself for a job that would replace me within a week if i dropped dead. Take care of yourself. I don't know what I am living for... I honestly don't know why I keep living another day, I have no one to love me, my very friends are dick heads, my parents don't care how i am feeling and when they do they just throw a bible verse at my face acting as if talking to some sky man is going to cure me, I have yet to even hug a girl in my life, probably because I'm such an ugly awkward beta shit... I have no plans for my future, I am overall retarded In school. All I can do is be an escapist by playing video games, watching videos, eating unhealthy food, and all i do is isolate myself from reality... My therapist is overall useless, all she does is repeat the same shit I hear from people...	1
We still hung out as friends, but she kept pushing for more.	1
Stranger: i believe in u man	1
Anyone else feel this way?Sometimes I wonder if I’m just a lazy fuck and not depressed at all My dad just scolded me over the phone because I was still in bed and its 2PM. My parents has been very nice and understanding since I told them about my depression. But when he said something along the lines of”no one stays in bed all day, everybody has to get up, you have friends who take the bus to work and work all night long. Why should you get special treatment? The only one who can change how you feel is you. And if you want to feel better you can’t play games all night and sleep all day”	1
Yours truly,	1
I was there to see a fresh dead corpse.	1
This is a post about my life basically, i just need to get this off my chest. Its a long post but i just have to do this.	1

It all started last year when I quit my bachelor in Physical Therapy. That study didnt seem right for me and I dropped out in feb 2016. From februari till september I've worked a depressing job in an order picking centre to pay for my next year of college. But after that there wasnt any motivation for anything left over in me.	1
You probably changed, you probably were capable of change, were strong enough to change yourself even. I'm not you.	1
Amy first met the depressed me a few months ago and she didn't run away. I thought she could be a big part of my support network moving forward. But I'm worried that I just tried to put too much on her. Like I've done a million times before.	1
This explains a lot about how I always felt me and my mom were outcast by my dad's family over the years.	0
But my grandma's dying. She was put into hospice over the weekend and can't do much of anything anymore. I love her so much as my grandparents/mom's side of the family have been the only stable family I've ever had. My grandmother is an amazing woman. She graduated as valedictorian of her college class. She raised 7 amazing children (all college grads and successful in their fields) and has 14 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. She's 90 and has lived an amazing life.	1
I’m gay guy that recently moved from a conservative town in Montana to the amazing city of Portland, OR. I came out of the closet the summer going into my freshman year of high school, dealt with a (simply put) shitty childhood while growing up in the Bible Belt of northern Florida, with an abusive father and worrying, even at the age of 7/8 about how my future would play out in this. My mom divorced and remarried a man that doesn’t accept my sexuality personally but supports my life decision  and says he loves me. We moved to Montana (my mom, me and him) and I began to feel like I did have a purpose when I was introduced to acting onstage at a local theatre that I fell in love with. Life, for a few years, was amazing but my high school at the time was having a crisis. Unfortunately four students had committed suicide between my freshman and junior year and, with the help of many, started a suicide awareness program in the city and lead that for a year or so. My senior year, literally three days before it started, my military brother committed suicide on base, it was suspected it was also his sexuality. But also in my senior year, near the end of it, I met a man whom I fell in love with (which is what I am getting too, just bare with me). We were able to spend a lot of time together for a month or two before he had to leave to Portland (before I had gone) for a work internship where he would go back home to Brazil once completed. He treats me like gold, and I really mean that, he has been nothing but amazing to me. He flew me out to Portland so I could visit him for two weeks where we fell even more in love. Everything was shattered when he left for home and I also left for an adventure.	1
So I exported every thing from the past 10 years onto it. Recently, my computer can't even read the hard drive anymore. I went to the customer help service and they said that they can't do anything to access my data and all they can do is replace it (within warranty).	1
I dunno I finally got people to forget about it and stop asking about what happened and I don't want it to start again I just wish I could forget everything or die	1
I just want to die. I really just want to kill myself this summer or at least move away.	1
(Also if anyone is interested in trying out the app, feel free to check it out [here](https://beok.herokuapp.com/). It's stupid simple and still a work in progress, but I'm still kinda proud of it... and if it were able to help even just one other person, that would make me pretty happy &lt;3)I find myself hating birthdays and Christmas now Those are the times when you’re surrounded by friends and feel loved. I don’t get that so I find myself starting to hate it.	1
Hey I saw your Post about your depression and can relate a lot to yo. I am a friend of guy and saw you live for the first time in city. I know how shit it feels to have phases like this and won’t say it becomes magically better, but you are doing an amazing job with your music. I know you don’t know me and I don’t know you, but if you want to talk to someone who comprehend what you are feeling, I would gladly do it.	1
I have no motivation at work. Therapy is not working and I need a new therapist, but I don't have the energy or self-love to care enough to do anything about my issues. I am in a black hole when everyone thinks I live a charmed life. I have been depressed since I was five years old and I don't know how long I can hold on without losing it.	1
Then I get a load of hate off her because people are contacting her about her choices. Remember, she has been posting on FB all about the baby, making sure everyone knows.	1
The next two days I unblocked my dad and sent some messages about how I was sorry I had to block my dad and clarified some of the things they were unhappy about (some of what they were unhappy about wasn't at all true). But I think both my parents have now blocked my number. Yet I can't blame them for doing that because I did it to them first, but I do wish I had just turned off my mobile, or been able to bear the burden of hearing shitty talk, instead of blocking my dad. (It's not possible to visit them as we live in different countries).	0
It's been two years. I've gotten better, met friends that helped me out a lot and I will probably never be able to repay it. But this past of mine, it still haunts me. I don't think I'll ever be able to trust someone like this again. I have gotten so cynical and careless about everything... It still hurts.I'm so lonely, but I'm not alone. I don't have anyone who I can truly feel comfortable being myself around, or telling the truth about how I feel. I have friends, they're not superficial, in fact they're wonderful people. I just can't let go from this facade that I have created - of this happy, easy going person. I know they wouldn't abandon me, yet it's a fear that aches constantly. Having a really bad stretch of days.. Hi all,	1
Have a smile. You deserve it ;)Coming to terms with life long depression It's always going to be there in my life, like a dark cloud creeping in on a sunny day, and I'm okay with that. After 7 long years of battling depression and going through the highs and lows that come with it and after dedicating myself to therapy, medication and lifestyle changes I have finally accepted that I am going to have to learn to live with depression for the rest of my life. It's my strength, it's my weakness and it makes my life unique. Why do people try to motivate depressives using shame? I never understand the idea of people attempting to shame me out of my depression.	1
Enough is enough. Simply put we wanna put our feet down - again. Except! I know what'll happen.	0
You: hmm ok. i guess accepting how life is has been the difficult part	1
By no means am I a traditionally religious person. I believe in a god, Jesus died for our sins, and all that good stuff. But I don't walk around preaching and forcing what I believe onto others, instead I try and be humble. I am really struggling here with my depression here as I write this out on my lunch break at work. I don't know if I can make it through today. I just got to thinking last night and a few days before: at this point, is it faith or apathy? I just don't really care about anything anymore, not for a long time, many years, in fact. I have always run my life according to my faith. God will provide, God will meet me half way, be thankful for all that I have. I am not struggling with my faith or anything but why am I still around? What am I looking for? What am I waiting on?	1
I got prescribed 10mg of escitalopram (Cipralex). Anyone else on it? Any tips n tricks? The side effects seem pretty standard for an SSRI. How would you describe your life at this point? I literally feel like my life is a complete crap! I’ve been holding my feelings in(self doubt, emotionally unstable) it’s been rough! I just quit my job because it was causing more panic attacks ...so now I’m without a job and still depressed! Basically life sucks for me!!!!Anyone else an immature adult here? Someone just told me to just "wake up" already... wish I could... I don't like being this way either. I know I am immature... but don't know how to change. I just am this way. I'm still obsessed with her. At the start of the year, I made a post talking about how I've been obsessed with an older girl for well over a year. Of course, nothing's changed.	1
It's driving me insane and making me feel like I don't care about them anymore. But before depression I would have laughed if you'd told me I didn't care about my family. I've always been full of love and empathy. Now I'm just angry and snappy with them. I feel like a monster.I want to die [trigger warning] [Trigger Warning]	1
I am not sure why I am writing it. I don't know how I found the motivation. Reddit sucks, and I’ve decided to delete it. Anytime I go outside the depression sub my opinions and comments are just shitted on because I’m not the same fake moral high or smug asshole that most other people on reddit seem to be. “Oh you have a non leftist opinion? Fuck you then!” Like seriously this is reddit front page in a nut shell and even any smaller sub Reddit’s there’s still a bunch of assholes everywhere. I come on here in an attempt to aid my depression but even on this sub, though allot of people are nice and kind and I really appreciate everyone’s kind words, it’s not helping me and I’m just gonna stop wasting my time. Tata fuck you reddit. Depressed sub people you guys are aight but fuck everyone else.I'm just waste of sperm Where to start?  Well I only life with my mom in shit apartment(my dad was alcoholic ect.) My mom is in debt because of school.. and has been in dept all her life. So all my 17 years we are poor. Sometimes we live without  electricity because she can't pay in time. In school when there's a road trip to somewhere I don't go and say I don't want to go because I can't afford. (sometimes I want to go but most of the time I don't because of my mental illness.. ) Sometimes i don't have nothing to eat for dinner . All my 17 years I only eat 2 different food at home..potatoes or pasta. Because we are poor my teeth are really bad of eating all the shit junk food. I just don't smile anymore. Sooo another problem is I'm stupid just plain stupid I had to repeat classes 2 times  and now I just don't care anymore because i will probably kill myself. I have low self-esteem. I SOO FCKING BAD HATE MYSELF  IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS. So I've got soo many mental problems like ocd, bipolar, depression, anxiety, social anxiety  sometimes I have panic attacks, I have signs of autism and im likely to be asexual. I have only 2 friends who I start to rarely see because I stay at home all day in bed . I have Phimosis too. So my life is just great. In my life I've never got what I wanted because we are poor... soo I just hate my life nothing gives me happiness. I don't really see the point in living tbh. Nothing just inteests me. We're just born to die. Nice. I would prefer to die before my mom dies  because I just couldn't bear with that.. Without my mom i wouldn't survive in this lazy shit world! I really hope Noone will read this i just wanted to rent. Give me luck to finally kill myself!  :)Law of Attraction is bullshit. Also hard work doesn't pay off. Everything in life is based on chance and luck only.	1

Then suddenly one day, everything changed. The passing of time took away from me my childhood, my friends, my beloved France. Life suddenly just changed like that. No more joy, no more innocence, no more real friends, no more homeland. No more beautiful sunny days, only darkness, depression, nostalgia and tears.	1

So I’ve become a little depressed.	1

Thank you for reading, sorry for taking up your time.Having to come to terms with being an empty shell of a person with zero confidence and social skills is the most depressing shit ever I hate myselfI finally came out to my close friends that I have depression, and now I'm being alienated because I'm "not mentally stable" Probably a rant, but what the fuck.	1
I have had extreme depression for 11 years. For as long as I can remember I have tried so hard to stay alive. There was a point in my life where I gave up. I remember my mom was beating me and I put up my hands to block the belt and I was crying. I remember after one of the times she struck me I started to think “what if I gave up?” And I just shut down. In that moment I stopped putting my hands up, stopped crying, and rolled into a ball while mom kept beating me for a few more minutes.	1
I’ve been so lonely lately too. Just wanting someone to care about me. I had it and fucked it all up at the beginning of the year, and I just regret it all the time. I drink by myself a lot at night to deal with the loneliness, but it makes it worse.	1
I know this is long and it might be hard to emphasize with me if you don't really understand it. But I just felt like I really wanted to say something and see if maybe there were other people like me. I guess you could say I'm looking for friends who can understand me, I'm hoping that maybe it will make living a little easier if I have people to talk about the things I love with who also understand what it's like going through depression.	1
I've done everything suggested on Google searches like putting your alarm clock across the room, setting daily goals, and trying to get myself excited for the next day but I would gladly just lay in bed all day.	1
Even when I have an accomplishment like a successful concert or a new track of music, my jerk brain still tells me that I'm shit and not good enough. Maybe I just need to hit the iron harder and keep getting in shape?	1

If you read the title you're probably thinking my father was the reason of my issues. He was not, I loved him very dearly. I am extremely sad he passed away while I'm in such a young age (I'm 21) but c'est la vie I guess..	1
Advice? Help? Anything? Anyone else been sad so long that moments of happiness are scary? I find that when I am happy I get scared and find a way to make myself sad again.Dear reddit, i need your help I've never had a good relationship with my family. I am 15/m and always seen by everyone as overly sensitive and feminine. Kinda makes my life harder. I was recently diagnosed with depression after someone called a sub division of the Canadian child services because I was a suicide risk. Right now I'm on vacation in park city, Utah… I'm the first and only one in my family with any sort if nenral problems. I end up freaking out on the inside and my parents just tell me that this is the best part if my life and u should enjoy it. Hesri g that makes me want to kill myself more than the usual amount because I know what torture it is to be alive and if this is the best it gets what is the point. It's currently 12:32 and I'm in the basement after my brother kicked me out of my own bed. I got about 5 mins of sleep before this happened and the part that really pisses me off about it is the fact that I'm an insomniac. It's a miracle I get anything and he just wakes me up. My brother is 10. When he was 8 and 9 he would have tried to drown me multiple times and stab me once. When my diagnosis came around he's been doing everything he can to.push me towards suicide. I go to tell my friends about things that have been said to me and things that I'm feeling and their response is always dude u have a gf don't be depressed or just what the fuck is wrong with u. For the past year I've been dating around and just before coming here I got broken up with. It seems like the whole universe is against me and I just need help I feel like if anyone got to really know me they'd find out I'm weird and awkward and they'd stop wanting to be around me. I'm terrified of getting close to people, but I want friends, so I keep doing this dance back and forth of trying to hang out with people then cutting contact before becoming friends.	1
Update - to people asking for a pic i dont really have a good photo yet but i posted on my page a quick clip of me meeting him. I look like shit cause ive been depressed but the clip cheers me up so oh well.Maybe I see the world for what it really is Maybe "healthy" people are the sick ones for being in denial.	1
Sorry for the long post and rubbish grammar (English isn't my first language) Thanks in advance.Hope https://gogetfunding.com/my-son-right/what's a friendship? How can I cut ties with my cousin? I’ve been wanting to stop all contact with my cousin. He’s toxic to me and my family relationship. He’s very controlling and manipulative. There’s a couple of problems though. He’s dating my girlfriends sister and we currently have the same job. I want to stop all form of contact with him. But i feel its impossible given the circumstances that we’re in.Female reasoning Why does it seem most women try to justify or get approval of a friendship with a male by stating knowing then for a lengthy time. Do women truly feel that no platonic boundaries will be broken because they’ve “known each other for 15 years/since freshman year” etc. I don’t believe it impossible for a platonic opposite sex friendship, but I do feel it is much harder for a male, for several reasons. Men typically seem to misinterpret a female being nice as expressing interest or flirting, that can easily plant the seed for a romantic attraction to develop. A mans “natural desires” and wants, can easily blur the lines, and when in the right environment/setting they feel it is acceptable to attempt something etc etc. I don’t see how whatever length of time negates the possibility of anything happening.	0

Stranger: but thats situational	1
Obviously, not discussing this decision with my doctor is unnecessarily dangerous and naive, but I just don't enjoy taking the medication and this past week kind of supports my idea that I don't really need to take the medication if I am able to function fine without it.	1
I'm thankful for those good days. But the bad days remind me that I want better for myself.	1
I told her once that I don‘t want solutions. I want someone to genuienly understand me. At first she tried and now it’s all solutions again. „Try this, try that, we need to experiment“. I get the thought but I feel like my deep down feelings are just irrelevant once again.	1
The first goes as "It is not worth the bother of killing yourself, since you always kill yourself too late."	1
My body awoke in a new person’s home, as I stared out into the busy road below my sleepy figure. An old woman came out from the corner, as I nervously responded with a gulp. We shared an exchange, as I sat and pondered the shelves of a life that I knew little about. I explored the past, only finding multiple recordings of enthusiasts. I folded my hands, recognizing that I meant nothing here.	1
I’ve been on Zoloft which made me feel like a numb zombie and bupropion which I didn’t feel was working. I’ve also tried Xanax (made me calmer but high) and a mood stabilizer that didn’t really help. I’ve since gotten off medication by my own choice but the problems are coming back. Generally I don’t like rx drugs and would rather do it naturally but it’s not going away.	1
Any advice?Martin Luther King Jr. And depression "As my sufferings mounted I soon realized that there were two ways in which I could respond to my situation -- either to react with bitterness or seek to transform the suffering into a creative force. I decided to follow the latter course"- King JR. Today got me thinking...We need to figure out how we can turn our discontent, anxiety, anhedonia, insecurity, self hatred, and the meaninglessness that we all feel into real world change that we can see, touch , and feel proud of in a tangible form. We need to figure out as a community, how we can re-direct our negative feelings into helping  others, and maby in the process we will be helping ourselves. I think alot of us feel meaningless, and have a hard time creating motivation to get us out of bed, besides our rare and far between moments of clarity. If we could find a way to re-direct our negative energy and encourage eachother to work towards causes we believe in, we could change the world while at the same time changing ourselves.At this point in my life, I have a "good job" and financial security, but I still experience horrible depression and that underlying feeling that im a failure and living a "meaninglessness existence". I have come to find that the only time I really feel "alive", or any feeling remotely resembling happiness is when I am either on drugs, or when I am helping people and making a difference. The latter of those two has actually improved my life, and I am hoping that as a depression community, we can motivate eachother to help re-direct our sadness to further causes that are meaningful to us, and hopefully squash our cynicism. "The Law of Conservation of Energy, states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; energy can only be transferred or changed from one form to another"19 years old and already miserable i just need to vent about how lost i feel in life. i have no dreams or ambitions about what i want to do as a career in my life, i have a job now which i suck at even though i basically only help my boss a few times out of the day and i only get about one shift every two weeks. i suck at driving even though its been a couple of months of constant driving practice trying to get my license. i've had girls interested me in the past but not for a long time even though i always manage to fuck it up anyway because im so socially awkward and i honestly feel like im going to be alone for life because i cant make a connection with any girl on earth. I feel like im losing my close friends even though we were all so close about a year ago. I already feel like a disappointment to my parents and i just want to lay in bed and listen to music all day everyday. Please tell this isnt how life is supposed to be, i feel like anxiety and this recurring sadness has taken control over me.[F17] I really need someone to listen This is a throw-away, because I don't want anyone in my personal life to see this. Let me preface this by saying I've been diagnosed with bipolar tendencies (i guess you can't diagnose bipolar disorder until you're 18), severe depression, chronic anxiety and body dysmorphia. I've been hospitalized for a suicide attempt almost two years ago, and I've struggled with self harm since fourth grade. I was bullied relentlessly throughout elementary and middle school. Thankfully, i've been clean for a year, and after the hospital I got on medication and things started to get better for a while. My senior year has been great so far but it's starting to get bad again. I used to be a social smoker, but now I'm completely dependent on marijuana for everything. I'm not hungry unless I smoke and I can't fall asleep unless I smoke. I need it to get through the day. I can't go to college, because I can't afford it and my mom says she can't consign on a loan for me. I totally understand that too, because if my dad were to die she'd be in trouble and in tens of thousands of dollars in debt. I'm just sad because I want to go away like all of my friends but I can't. My dad is most likely going to lose his job soon apparently too, which is going to put us in poverty. My mom and dad fight all the time, and hate each other. They've both talked about getting a divorce to me exclusively. I pretend like it doesn't bother me, but it does. My dad is addicted to prescription painkillers, and locks himself in his room the minute he gets home. He comes to my choir concerts, plays, and musicals but leaves almost immediately after it starts, which hurts me a lot. I pretend like I don't care about that either. The thing that hurts me the most now is my dog was put down today. She was my first dog. I was allergic to dogs when I was way younger. I grew out of it and it took so long to find her, because my mom was set on picking the perfect dog for us. We found her, and now she's gone. I was the one who stayed in the room with her, because my mom couldn't do it. I pet and comforted her while she died. I've never had to cope with someone dying before, and it's so hard. She was just a dog, but I still loved her so much. I want her back so bad. My problems are so minor compared to some people's, but I'm so sad right now. I don't know what to do. This is the first time in a while that I've wanted to kill myself, but I don't want to go down that road again. I just don't know how to cope anymore. My Boyfriend Talks Daily About Suicide -- Won't Go To Hospital Hi guys, I'm really just at a loss for what to do. I am absolutely gutted.	1
I do everything and anything to make her feel wanted.	1
Because of this, I'm reluctant to claim I'm depressed except in the loose, colloquial sense. Instead, I feel my rage and despair flow quite appropriately from my failure to fulfill my desires, achieve my dreams, and so on. I hate being alive and would adore a sudden death, sure, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm depressed, right?	1
Now that I've vented, I just don't want to feel alone. I want this to go away. I want to be excited to see my boyfriend at the end of the day, and excited for the day I may marry him. I want to have a hobby I am passionate about. I want to go to work and be happy and thankful I have a job that I do. I want to feel love for my mom and dad.	1
I try. I go to work. I exercise. I eat healthy. I tell myself “improve for yourself and no one else”. It’s a lie.	1
Its also not like i dont have people in my life, its rather that i dont feel comfortable enough around them to do so.	1
How can I help prevent her from harming herself another time? What other things are there that I should be aware of concerning her well being?	1
I'm at my wit's end, he's my best friend and I'm very in love with him, but I just don't know how to be better for him. I'm up at 3 in the morning, school tomorrow, crying because I'm afraid of losing the one person who hasn't given up yet. I don't know what to do. When people surrounding you keep thinking that you’re trying to act cool over your mental illness. I’m depressed. And those people around me always think that I’m just trying to act deeply, or being cool. They ask me to become “normal” but I still don’t get what kind of “normal” that they mean. Depression is not cool, it’s not a lifestyle, why people keep assuming me of hating them just because I don’t enjoy making fun and telling them stories?I've been reading this subreddit for awhile. Well, as the title says I have been reading this stuff for months. I think I'm depressed. I'm not sure why though. I have a really good long-term boyfriend, everything I need and a lot of things I just want. I've been "depressed" as long as I can remember. I think about killing myself every day, multiple times a day. Like, "oh, i dropped something, well better kill myself" "Oh, I failed that math problem, you're worthless better kill yourself now" I can barely shower most days. I don't know why my boyfriend hasn't broken up with me. Sometimes I wish he would so I could just kill myself. I feel really bad for him.	1
You: yes	1
I think it's because I use Reddit a lot as someway of just... Keep my mind full, away from my problems and feelings. So when someone makes you feel something, it's like a hit of reality.	1
When I finally did manage to get in touch, it was to collect my stuff.  I took a mutual friend with me, the act as a buffer, and they couldn't believe the stuff that she said to me.	1
For over a year we talked about me moving to their town, so i can get closer to her, her husband and her kids.	1
I work at a job in an office doing pointless work that I used to swear to myself in high school and college that I’d never wind up doing. 5 days a week I wake up at 7, leave at 7:30, work from 8-5, and get home (at my parents’ house) at 5:30. Then I eat dinner with them, watch TV with them, and they go to bed, so I turn in at 9, watch more TV, and go to bed myself. On the weekends I typically do nothing. When I do go out or hang out with a friend, we do nothing, just sit and watch TV or a movie. Unless we can find some fictional world we can discuss (Marvel, GoT, Star Wars, etc) we don’t even have much to talk about. I maybe have 2-3 friends that I do this with, and again, not too often.	1
Since everything I've had some real down point, and made two attempts, by failed due to people walking in randomly either whilst in progress or while setting up. I've already made necessary precautions by writing letters, addressing them and stamping them but non have been sent. I want to tell my gf but I feel like, I don't want to throw feelings away by her thinking 'he's a sobbing kid, or he's crazy or why am I with him' - I'd rather hide it not to upset her, people mean everything in the world to me, and I'd give my life for her, any day. But I still want to tell her, and I don't her to be scared of me.	1
What should I do and how should I do it? I know I can get through this. I’ve done it before, so I really don’t want him to worry. Any thoughts? Today is her Birthday. I thought I was moving on. Today is your birthday.	1
I used to be like you guys. I can’t say that I suffered as much as you guys but I came to this sub a couple of times when I had no one else to go to. I had no shoulder to cry on in my freshman year of college which is why I think this app could actually mean something to someone.

At least it looks like it in my caseThey say be yourself, but what if yourself is someone nobody (including yourself) likes? I can just tell that people...tolerate me. Even my own "friends." It makes me want to just walk into the woods. Does anyone else feel this way?Im feeling suicidal and very hopeless right now, does anyone want to chat? I think I'm going to give up the fight soon enough. Almost another year past, another year deeper into the hole.	1
I don't understand because he has been constantly renewing my prescription for years and never said anything about tapering off or stopping. I once went a month cold turkey during a health insurance issue and around the 3rd week I had attempted suicide.	1
And even when I rewire my sleep schedule back to normal, I still end up going back to the messed up sleep schedule just cause I hate feeling depressed and hate dealing with it.My brother has depression and I need help I’ll start off by saying I’m not sure if this is the right place to say this and if it isn’t, I’d love if you could point me in the right direction. My brother has a multitude of things such as depression, anxiety and anger issues. Recently he has been going to IOP (can’t exactly remember the name, but it’s a step below inpatient care) at a facility and he has shown some progress. I feel like he’s more in touch with how he feels and is working on coping mechanisms better. However he did not go to his session today and that caused problems. He got his check from work today and it would not get deposited, and that set him off into a fit. He started breaking things and getting in both mine and my parents faces, cussing and attacking us. We had a conversation after and he said he tells himself the thing we tell him, such as how he needs to be more rational and more committed to getting better. He also eats unhealthy and is overweight, and I’ve attempted to help him get healthier about a month ago, but he stopped listening to me about. I love and care for him deeply but our family is at our wits end with what to do. I would want to leave him be and let him sort his issues out without us harassing him about it but when he gets violent and angry around the house we can’t sit idly. I’m not sure what the next step is but I’d love to hear advice from anyone. Thanks for listening. Just Checking in Just wanted to wish everyone a good day.  This subreddit is so important to me. Couldn’t function without it.  I hope you all have a great day!I wanted to post something I moved from the USA to Peru, i thought on my 21 y/o it would be a good idea but it wasn't :'( now I'm all alone and unemployedWhat’s wrong with me? I have an amazing family and an incredible group of friends. The support is there and they’ve tried to help in the past but I can’t burden them with my troubles anymore, it just feels uncomfortable. I’ve seen a three therapists in my life each no more than two times. I’m not sure why I can’t just get myself to keep seeing one consistently. I’m waiting on grades from summer school but I’m fairly positive I failed and will subsequently be kicked out of college. I’m 23 and still have over year left to go. I don’t know where to turn. I don’t know how to move forward. I can’t sleep at night and during the day all I want to do is lay in bed. My productivity is at an all time low which is saying something, trust me. I feel like I’ve lost it. I think I hate myself. I always try to be friendly with people I tired of pretending I'm so happy and giddy but I don't know how to stop, my family notices the change of personality when I'm talking to someone outside the family.	1
It went as far as that i started to get suicide thoughts. I do not feel any ups or downs in my life. Things i used to like to do isles enjoyable. I rather stay at home than being social.	1
I’m alone as I’ve ever been. I can’t even have guy friends because I’m bad with competition. I don’t even realize it, it’s all subconscious. I’m an asshole and I’ve just been a dick to people who just don’t deserve it. I’ve been so selfish.	1
I feel like I've done every thing I can, but it's no use... I don't know what to do.I feel worse everyday and I'm worried I'll have some type of breakdown I cry every single day, it's been 60 days. I talk about it but is like talking to noone at all. I talk all the time.	1
- June 2017 I told her I liked her as more than a friend, she didn't feel this way towards me at the time.	1
Just needed to get some thoughts out, I've gotten about 2 hours of sleep in the last 3 days and it's not for the lack of trying. I just wish I knew how to fix myself when I was still fixable.What music do you guys listen to cope with this curse we call deppresion? For me i listen to metal and rock. It really helps 👍theres nothing to look forward to i used to tell myself that after high school things will improve, I can get away from home and college will be fun. i guess i wont really know until im there, but im not excited at all for college. I feel like im going to go through the motions in college and end up alone in a shitty job i dont care about since i dont care about anything and everything will just spiral downwardsExtrovert stuck in an introverts lifestyle Im at a point in my life where I rely on social interactions for happiness. I hate being alone. The only problem with this is I have never known/wanted to actively make friends. Im stuck in a dark spot and I don't know how to introduce more people in my life. I [18f]don’t know what’s wrong with me. The past year has been good for me. I’ve not been nearly as suicidal as past years and I’ve gotten back in school and met the love of my life but the past few weeks/ days I’ve been sinking really bad. Ive distanced myself from my boyfriend and my very few friends. I’ve just laid in bed and thought about ending everything. I don’t know why the sudden lack of will to live. It’s like I’m 15 again and I’m scared any moment I’ll end my life. I don’t want to want this. I have cats that nobody would take and a little sister that would be devastated. I think my future could be amazing but I’m not sure it’s worth feelings like this much longer. I have nobody to call to distract me bc my boyfriend is busy and I’m so scared. How to not be discouraged that I suck and people younger than me are better Love playing guitar and piano but I'm 16 and people who are like fucking 7.8,9, 10 are beasts like I wish I could join a band and shit like them but I just started playing like a month ago and I'm really bad and slow and horrible and not progressing st the rate I want to even though I put in so much effort :/ also playing gives me anxiety even though I like it I'm always just so scared and agitated ): I think I'm dropping out of college Been depressed for a while and I'm currently on medication and about to start therapy.	1
My boyfriend has pretty serious depression and is in dire need of help. I won't be able to get him in to see a therapist until next week. He has recently become quite down on his luck and he hates himself for it. His anxiety stopped him from going to work, and he was fired. He has a new job now, but he hates it as it is a factory job where he works 60 hrs/week.	1
I've hit a complete rock wall in therapy. I tell my therapist nearly all of this shit and she helps me as best she can but there's only so much she's able to do. She has no magic way of instilling me with motivation. Like... to put it into perspective. I stared at a wall for 2 hours today. Because I just was to tired to anything else. 2 hours! I wasn't thinking about anything. I wasn't being bored. I just don't have motivation to do anything!	1
It hurts so much.What would you do? What do you do when your depressions effects you so much to the point you don't eat or you over eat, you don't sleep or you over sleep, you don't talk to anyone or pretend to want to be around people. What do you do when your depression doesn't allow you to be motivated and takes away all the enjoyment from your life that makes you happy, removing music, dancing and laughing in replace for dark rooms, teary eyes, and silence. What do you do when you won't answer your phone being that only the bill collector is calling, cause you're not able to pay the credit thats pilling up that helps you survive, being that you can't work or can't make money cause of no interest too cause of lack of motivation, cause the thoughts running through your head being that you can't talk to anyone, or that you won't, or that you're disappointed, or that you feel like a burden. Now your phones off and there's no call but the collector is there, no text this shit isn't fair, so what's next? Social media? You can make it or it can break you, driving you to want to do the very thing you try not to think of day by day because you don't know what to do. What would you do?Is this it? Is this really all there is? There is no escaping the struggle of human existence to just simply die and it's all gone to time? Moments of happiness are fleeting and never last. Pain stays with us for longer. Pain and chaos happen to all people. Suffering is a widespread human emotion. Why do we put on a masquerade amongst each other? Why put yourself through an existence of pain?	1
My issues are that My mom’s constantly calling me a disappointment and compares me to my sister. Im a let down. I just want to make my mom proud of me. I work 1 job and i go to college full time. My gpa is fucked :/	1
It might just be a placebo type of thing, but it would be great if any of you guys can recommend more alternatives/habits to do when depressed.	1
In the end, you found somebody new, which is fine. I chose, whether consciously or unconsciously to stay on a different path. I've tried new women. Many beautiful on the outside, but they aren't you. Oh no, no, no. They all don't have what you had.	1
However, I'm not unmotivated. Like at all. I'm not hopeless. I'm not suicidal in any way. I'm terrified of death in fact one of my biggest fears is that I'll get so depressed that I'll become suicidal which is weird, I know but the point is, nothing in me wants to die.	1
My parents came up to see me and had a difficult time accepting what had happened and I didn’t understand why. They knew I wanted help, they saw the scars on my arms, and they knew that I wasn’t okay.	1
The point of this story is I am an adult now who is married. I am a software engineer. I am financially stable. Regardless of how dark it gets it is possible to make it out on top. You have to focus and be strong. Do whatever you need to do to survive.	1
Should I really end it?I got a girlfriend!! Jk no girl will ever love meDo you ever feel like you can't do anything right and everyone secretly hates you? I've felt like that for as long as I can remember, and it feels like no matter how many times people tell me it's not true, I can't convince myself that I'm not a worthless waste of human existence and that everyone doesn't see me for the shitty person that I am. How can anyone else like me if I don't even like myself? I'll always be alone with only my parents caring about me because they feel obligated to and they probably don't think I could function without them. Even with them, I can barely function. Even in objectively good circumstances I feel this emptiness Do you also feel this empty hole inside you while doing objectively interesting things like being on a holiday or doing something with your friends. This lack of feeling is it's own kind of devastating in my opinion since you can not blame your bad surroundings for your feelings thereby losing hope and any motivation for improving your live since you will only continue having this numb feeling you always have anyway.Standing in the Rain Standing in the rain	1
I felt myself faint, awaking to two strangers cycling the door between storage and the hands of all waiting for me. “What were you thinking?” the woman asked, “What did you say?” the man asking. “I don’t know.” I responded, lying on my side, as they both awkwardly stepped out, with a cracked expression of what was me walking out. I felt a blankness ride across my body, as I stared upon a wall that reminded me of life.	1
Context:	1
This is a record low point in my life, but tonight I changed how I feel about it by just getting some chores done, getting drunk, and treating myself the way I wish other people would treat me. I'm talking booze and watching horrible telivision from the 80's	1

Idk it'd be nice to talk to someone, about anything even. I only have one friend who knows I have problems with depression but I don't want her to deal with my emotional baggage.Does Trading Help Your Depression? Maybe I am a bit weird in this regard, but I do quiet well in this regard. I have not traded too much because of life circumstances, and thus the past few years have been depressed, as my one best friend is in jail and the other has adopted asceticism. I also moved to a new area and broke up with my ex. I have been thinking stuff over, and even though winning at coding can make me slightly happy, I feel like whenever I am trading I am on fire and feel like my "true" self, whereas otherwise I feel blah. When I mean trading I mean medium term investing based on value investing. IDK if the risk and reward part overruns me, but when I think about that I don't think about my lack of dating or how this or that sucks, I focus on kicking ass and taking names. Anyone else ever get a feeling like that? IDK if this is taking on risky behavior for the sake of it or merely finding my muse. I Empathize More With the Dead Than I Feel Bad for the Living There have been a few times in the past few years where I found out someone I went to high school with died of whatever means. But within the past few months, whenever I found out someone died, I didn't really feel bad for their family, I mostly was kind of jealous that they were gone and I was still here.	1
I'm about to start tms therapy. Has anyone here tried it? I don't want to get too optimistic after the utter failure that was the pills, but I would really like some encouragement so that I don't feel like I'm throwing my money away. It's covered by my insurance, but the co-pays do add up for the whole procedure.I think I ruined another friendship TL;DR: Made a wonderful friend, had a depressive episode, and ruined the friendship by trying to force my problems on her. Just like I've done a million time before.	1
I hate myself, I just broke a mirror and my hands are bleeding. Please when will these emotions pass? Should i save up for sugery? Will i feel beautiful then? Why does my sister look like a model, my bro too 6"4 and attractive.	1
My blood sugar levels has been up and down lately. But even if they are controlled i feel the same.	1
if anyone ever reads this, you're stronger than me.im so lonely i can hardly stand it anymore literally all of my friends are getting into relationships and while im genuinely happy for them i want to experience that too. i can feel myself becoming more bitter everydayThis is the nicest group of people on the internet. I would come here everyday even if there wasn't so much helpful advice on here. Especially when I'm having a particularly bad time, when I don't even feel like playing my PS4. Instead of just staring at my game library I open up this subreddit. Makes me feel like I'm not alone. And with everything shitty going on in this world, and all the shitty people around me/us, it's really comforting to see a community online that is being so nice and helpful to each other.Going to bed in the morning, waking up at night. For about a year now, I've been going to sleep in the morning when the rest of my family is getting ready to start their day and getting out of bed in the evening/night.	1
Which brings me to the other issue. When she does call me it's the most disrespectful phone etiquette I have ever seen. After she knows she is going to get a ride she stays on the call(must be out of guilt or not wanting to make it seem like it's the only thing she wants.) but while she's on the phone she does not pay attention to me. Like she'll make active listening sounds that don't match up, like uh huh and a giggle when I just told her that I might need to give my cats up. Without telling me or warning or any sort of hint she'll just start talking to someone else around her like I'm not even on the other end. Worst yet almost always these calls are while she is at work and is just bored. On my end I'm distraction free and at the most filling out a job applications or pacing and I dunno I feel like if you are going to call your friend you should acknowledge they are on the other line and not just background noise while you browse the internet.	0

I suppose I actually came here hoping people would tell me not to ditch her, but I know I can't keep letting her treat me like this.	1
I sat the bicycle at it’s rack, hands in pocket as I blinked at the glaring sun. A numbness hit my heart, and for the next eight hours, I’d lose who I was, only coming back at the rise of a pounding rain. I walked from a distant building, taking the long path to a home that didn’t know me. I took the rugged bicycle, and stared up above at the shadowy clouds.	1
Stranger: are u depressed	1
I don't need to feel comforted or understood, I need help from people and receiving advices on how I can improve my life or stories of people feeling better. Something which is really lacking on this sub. I want to feel better and I don't care about intellectualizing my pain or feel comforted. If one day I feel I have no hope and no chance of feeling better I will kill myself. Today sucks, but tomorrow might not, so let's just try doing tangible efforts.	1
Edit: formattingI have gone days without talking to anyone I just got out of a bad relationship recently. But I have a issue with dependancy. I let him dictate my entire life. I let him into my head to the point I feel brainwashed. I hate everyone. I don't trust anyone. I don't want to talk to anyone because I know he will get mad and be jealous. He is the closest and only person I have in my life and even though we broke up he wants us to remain best friends. We dated for 2 years and it was Rocky the entire time. But I let him get his hooks into me and I can't get out. I am terrified to not have him in my life because then I will be truly alone. I don't talk to anyone else. I am 26 years old and I have 0 friends other then him. I am terrified of being alone. But he is seeing someone else now. She is 100 times better then me in every way. She is super model gorgeous and everything that me and him shared she has as well. I feel replaced. But I don't want to not be his friend and not have him in my life. I'm terrified to lose him. I cling to the hope one day he will want me again. I haven't talked to another person in over a week. and if he is busy with her I don't talk to anyone at all. I just lay on my couch staring at the wall and having a constant never ending panic attack. I have sever depression and severe anxiety that I take medicine for both. But they only make the feelings bearable and don't take them away completely. I don't sleep. I just want to throw myself at every fuck boy on dating apps just to have some kind of physical attention even if it is only sex. Even if I am not attracted to them. I don't care. I just want someone to love me. I want someone to hold me and make me feel not alone. I don't know what to do. I feel like I've been kicked in the chest. It hurts to breathe. I made a noose and stood on a stool with it around my neck for over a hour the other night crying. But I couldn't do it. I don't know how to go on living. Help Hey I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I need help...I’m 20, about to have my college degree and have a pretty solid job but mentally I’m so fucked. I had a rough breakup about a month ago and ever since I’ve just been down &amp; depressed. Feel like shit about myself, like I can do no right. Like I have nothing to live for. And I’ve had struggles with depression before but this time seems much more intense and worse like it won’t ever go away. I’ve been thinking about suicide more and more and I don’t know what to do Just a vent post I went grocery shopping with my mom. I manged to get on the topic of politics and I mentioned how it would be bad if people could start discriminating against someone because of their religious freedom. She told me it should be okay to do this (brought up the whole baker thing to prove her point) while saying this she told me she loved me, but didn't like how I'm gay (pansexual with some hints of genderfluid, though she doesn't know the last part) because it's a sin.	1
Have been seeing therapists for months, talking to them and trying to find a way on how to see life differently. Thankfully I’m not prescribed any of those fucking pills, because my current therapist is smart enough to know they aren’t the best medicine for me.	1
I quit on Friday; the owner asked me to come in yesterday and meet, and I did, but I didn't stay long, because she didn't show up and the other doctors on staff acted like my resignation never even happened.	1
" kill yourself already, like what are you waiting for ? " ( the right moment ) School is making me so stressed It’s all the time. I fell asleep last night feeling okay about stuff but woke up anxious and depressed not wanting to go to my classes. I have been failing 2 of my most important classes and I just have no reason to keep going to them. It’s finals week and I’ve been stressed about finals since school started. I don’t even know if I want to stay in school anymore because I don’t want to feel like this.	1
You have time to relax now? Think again. There's always someone needing something or things that need to be done.	1
Stranger: but that allows us to do many things other animals cant, but its still kind of dreary	1
My favorite are the people who say “you need to let go. Just let go of the past.” These are the people that post dumbass quotes on Facebook and Instagram who haven’t experienced a day of depression in their lives. Let go of WHAT? What does that even fucking mean? I ask these people to go into detail, and they don’t. They act like a fucking monk, and just say, “You just have to let go.”	1
Stop and think for a moment. Because no matter how long a storm lasts, You still enjoy the rain... You still love the sound of thunder.I just feel awful all the time I feel like im suffocating all the time. Sometimes idk if i really have depression because i dont think im like guilty of anything i just feel so tired and i dont want to do anything,  i get easily irritated and i hate everything,  sometimes i get so overwhelmed i dont know i feel like im drowning, i know i supress my emotions i know i do but i can't express myself anywhere and i have no one to express myself to,  i feel bad for telling my friend whenever i feel bad because she has it worse and she doesnt really know what else to say.  I feel exhausted all the time.  I face animosity at home and at my dorm i feel trapped and i just want to give up on everything. Sometimes i wish my bus gets crashed into, sometimes i feel like flinging myself across the street, sometimes i feel like screaming and sometimes i feel like sitting and not do anything,  i hate school, i hate my house, my family hates me my mom suffocates me, i hate everything,  i feel numb towards everything but then i want to cry all the time,  sometimes i just want to lie in bed and waste away but i can't i have to go to school,  im not even sure i like my major, sometimes i just feel like i shouldnt even be here liks my existencs doesnt even matter so what's the point im not special im no one i do nothing i just want to start over, i can't drivw cause im afraid ill purposefully get into a car crash to just end it. I just want to be at peace, my mind keeps racing and most of the time idk what im feeling i just don't know. I want to be saved but i dont have anyone and i should save myself. But idk idk I Want to Scream Until It Stops and the World Makes Sense Again (update) A few good days had me fooled into thinking I had control over myself and my life. The only thing holding back from suicide is my mother and how much killing myself would fuck her up. But she's in her 60's and as soon as she's gone, I don't see anything else holding me back from following after. I just want to stop existing. I just want it all to stop. When staring at the blank wall is no longer boring. Does anyone else find themselves just staring at something, lost in endless thought? It’s been a few months since I’ve cut and now my mom really fucked with me tonight, is there any way anyone on here can help or talk to me? I don’t want to start cutting again. Sometimes, I stand in front of the mirror and think "why would anyone ever love you?" Why is it so hard for people to accept me? I’m lonely (AKA it’s hard making friends as an adult) I have some friends, not a whole ton, but it seems they never want to talk or hang out. I know they’re busy but I’m just lonely. It’s hard making friends as an adult.Feel like depression has made me retarded I can feel whats left of my intelligence waning, my short term memory is non-existant and i even struggle to read and follow movies. Is this typical of depression? Can i recover my mental acuity?Lately I’ve been thinking about the fact that dying doesn’t scare me and I honestly don’t care if I do. The only thing that bothers me is how it would affect the people around me. I don’t want to die necessarily the idea of it just doesn’t bother me.Weekends are the worst There's nothing to distract myself on the weekends. I did spend time with friends Friday and Saturday, but the majority of the time I just sit at home and watch youtube or do some other dumb shit. I've been trying to quit drinking and smoking weed, but they really numbed the weekend away to make it bearable. Now I'm just a sad sap with nothing to do. I am trying to take up hobbies to fill the time but it seems pointless. The worst part is that I have had some really good days this week and I thought that maybe I was better. The depression is worse after I've felt genuinely happy for the first time in a long time. I've been overwhelmed with cravings for alcohol all weekend and I've been trying to get some homework done, but all I can focus on is wanting to drink. Maybe I should just get drunk to make them go away for a while.Music has a huge effect on my moods Music has a huge effect on my moods. I have been having an okay day with a good amount of anxiety and my depression hasn't been so strong. The depression is not of course gone. It's just not as bad today. I was listening to this song that I like which is ironic but it's a pretty sad song. It triggered me and made me really sad and made my depression worse. I was thinking of my abuse, my relationship with my girlfriend and other things during it. I was thinking of a lot of things and then my mood flipped.	1
I've been gone for a long time, now. There is nobody here but bad habits and terrible feelings. Sometimes I feel a semblance of someone who just wanted to make other people happy and be loved, but I think the misery just piled on like miles of permafrost.	1
Release yourself of your roles and see yourself as a person dealing with other people. Take a moment right now, take a deep breath and appreciate how there is so much effort taken in making the world as it is. We harnessed the elements and made the surface of the world a little more enjoyable. Sit back and enjoy all this hard work.	1
In college, I was so afraid of being alone that I wouldn't want guys to leave my room. And there were a fair amount of them. I'd beg them to stay longer and tell them I had separation anxiety. As long as I was focusing on them, I didn't have to focus on me. I justified it by saying that I was 'enjoying' my college experience and 'exploring' my sexuality.	1
Fuck this. Hello out there.... Ugh. I battle with depression, anxiety, bulimia, OCPD, BPD, and some physical health issues. Not so sure about battle right now. Maybe more like grudgingly coexist with?	1
My friends in school always rushed me about my career, they made fun of me because I didn't know what to study. I was the best in my class so they were surprised. I stopped talking to them because I was so ashamed about dropping out university. I started studying IT Engineer career but I couldn't take it. I feel like that wasn't for me. I'm afraid that I would never find something that I really like. Please don't judge me like them.	1
Theses days if something negative happens I tumble rapidly. If something positive I inch up a little. Something is not right.	1
You feel the wind blow in your face. You freeze. All the good moments, All the good people. It all comes in floods of part nostalgy and part regret.	1
Recently things have gotten worse due to my university workload. I've been having trouble completing assignment and functioning in general. I've considered getting help but I feel deeply uncomfortable at the thought of opening up to someone, since I'm not a very emotional person. I've come to accept that I will probably never be happy. I've always wondered if I would be more likely to actually commit suicide if I ever attained the level of success I desire since I would have then achieved my goal in life, or if that would finally bring me the contentment I seek. I suppose it would be the former since I can never be content. I’m not sad. I’m not sad, but I’m lost and have no motivation in doing anything.  It’s hurting my school work, and I am losing my grades.  The only thing I want to do is play video games all day.  I don’t know where to go, I’m just lost.  I’ve asked my parents for help at extreme lows, but they think I’m faking and their insurance is awful.  I don’t know anymore.Unstuck yourself I used to be stuck in negative mood and had suicide plan at one point. I didn't see the point of doing anything nor meaning of  life itself. One day a light bulb went off. I realize the world is much bigger than any of us could see or imagine from our corner at a given time. We shouldn't refuse to do things just because we don't understand the point. Instead we should celebrate the gift we are given. Just go do things because we CAN! If you are lonely, go talk to a homeless person. You will be surprised how much you could learn. If someone did you wrong at one time, forgive them and live for the future. Life has so much for us to explore. The trick is to start on one thing. Put left foot before right foot, then next ... You will feel better soon once you stop feeling by start doing. I am so fucking lonely... My husband is my best friend. Hes my dude. And when hes busy I have friends to fall back on as well. Recently the whole family got back to back sickness and we were basically quarantined for two weeks just bumming around trying to get better. So I let my kid watch too much tv, let my husband play all the video games, so i could do my stuff with out being bothered as well. Let me also say, I didnt plant my kid in front of the tv for hours on end, but I have to shower, and keep up with the house because man colds are much more sever (no...). Now that were better his behaviors have continued, even though i have spoke to him many times; things wont be like this when were not longer sick. My kid isn't a tv kid and I plan to keep it that way as long as I can.. but he.. he doesn't want to spend time with me any more, just step away from electronics and just chill and talk and play with our kid together... so I wanted to talk to my friends or even my mom... and I realized I don't have very many friends.	1
It's all gone when i sleep,  I'm at peace.  My mind isnt running through everything that makes me feel like trash.	1
I feel bad that I’m the one at school that’s known for never smiling. That must be why no one tries to talk to me. Dreams of ex Just as things were getting better, it all crumbled on me with dreams of her. We broke up in early December, no contact ever since.	1
She's CONSTANTLY lying to me about everything. She is so very unreliable, in the last 2 weeks twice now she's made plans with me for the next day, only to show up on facebook at like 8pm after I've been sitting and waiting for her all day and then she gets angry with me for telling her it makes me feel like shit.	1
Then the words came to me.	1
The other half can’t stop wondering how deep of a depression I am in and if I will ever get out. Three cheers for chemical imbalances!Can somone help me find a documentary on mental illness? I saw this older documentary about this baseball player who had a mental breakdown  awhile back. He wasn't famous. It was on youtube. Does this sound familiar? He had a beard and so did his dad. He lived in a mental hospital. It was like from the 80s I'm pretty sure. I’m so fucking pathetic I’m a retarded child in the body of an adult. I’ll never fucking get anywhere in my miserable and worthless life. I’m so fucking retarded. I deserve to fucking die. Painfully.	1
Tonight, under a drunken wine induced depression, followed by the realization that someone I trust had betrayed it and lack of anti depressants, i seriously considered slitting my wrists in the bathroom. While sobbing with my hands in my face, trying to figure out who would take care of my son and my unpaid debt, I looked up to see my cat staring at me. She has this stern, mothering expression in her eyes, and we locked eyes for the longest time. She kept my gaze until my sobbing was under control and I really thought about my actions. Maybe she just wanted wet food.	1
No Focus on Nothing Nothing stays in Focus Why the fuck can't I be somebody else's Focus	1
My experience was a pleasant one overall. I went there and focused on fixing my issues and I'd say I came out feeling better. I'm not sure if I can or should give the name of the place but I'm sure someone can let me know down below. I just want to share my experience and help people not feel so afraid of going to one.	1
I tried to end it. Swallowed sleeping pills and drank alcohol. I woke up the next day in a hospital. I woke up to a text from her. One that said she wishes my mother was torn apart by the girl's dogs...	1
All I want is to not feel this way anymore. Every time I leave my apartment I am tense and in fear of the people around me. I escape for social situations as soon as possible only to get home and feel completely worthless. I can accept that I will always live with this illness, that it is never going away. I just want to find a way to make it bearablei can never sleep when i need to 5:22 am on a school night. no sleep yet. saturday night? fell asleep at 8pm. fuck school. fuck life Just saw my ex with another man We broke up a couple of months ago cause she cheated on me and just saw her out with another dude and fairly sure she went to his house afterwards, they seemed really close and I’ve never seen this guy before so can only assume they met after we broke up. Feeling pretty shit right now.Can we talk about personal hygiene, or lack of there of I really can’t even remember the last time I showered, and it’s not even me enjoying being a nasty bitch I just  don’t want to? I mean, I don’t like feeling dirty or like I smell bad, but the thought of getting in the shower, bathing, washing my face, getting out, putting lotion on , etc. just sounds like to much work. The most I can do is brush my teeth, but other than that I lay in bed.	1
You: also brb	1
Please, all and every opinion or suggestion is welcome. Thank you if you took the time to read this and I wish everybody the best of luck with your own problems no matter what they be. May peace of mind and soul find you all.	1
So my story is that I've had depression and social anxiety for about 15 years or so (at least that's when I recall starting to feel "off".. I'm 29 now).. Because of my poor decision to bottle things up and accept that I'm unhappy I put off seeking help until about a month or two ago in which I started going to therapy. It had taken a rather bad mental fallout that occurred in early December for me to finally reach out for help.	1
The clear message capitalism sends me is that if I can't work, or I can't work enough, or I can't work doing a "high value job", or if I need help to get better so that I can do those "high value jobs", I probably ought to just go die, because I'm clearly worth nothing.How do I stop running away from problems or escape from them? All I do is pile my problems onto future me and live in the present, staying at home all day being depressed, which is still the 'happiest' that I can be. Inevitably I will have to face the consequences of the stacks of work I've neglected, but is there just some way for me to get out of this loop? I don't know what to do, especially when all I want is to be miserable and depressed until I kill myself. HelpNo freedom I feel like people don't want to hear me out anymore whether be on the internet or real life I've started to resort back to isolation it's dark and alone but at least someone listens here.Is anyone else a fucking drug addict I’ve been on Herion and vicion and benzos and stoned. I’m so fucked. I started bc of my depression to not for some great high Well, it's been a year now since I tried killing myself A year ago on December 1st I tried to kill myself. I spent a week in a psych ward and have been on lots of meds and doing lots of therapy since then. The therapy has helped quite a bit, I've slowly learned how to listen to myself and how to take things one day at a time. As far as meds go, my anxiety is much more controllable and my sleeping meds actually work (mostly) so I can't complain too much.	1
I need 3-4 months of working to even earn enough money for one month of living, i dont have enough willpower for it.	1
Lately, I've been going to sleep later and later into the day just so I can avoid ppl and avoid dealing with depression/being sad. But, by the time I do wake up/can't sleep anymore, I feel more depressed than when I originally was. And yet, despite all of that, I still have this need to sleep excessively because I keep having dreams that are more entertaining, adventurous, and exciting than what's currently going on in my life.	1
TL:DR: I rely on daca to have an even somewhat decent life. It's being taken away. I'm losing everything.Is it obvious when you have depression? I wonder if I have some form of mild depression or I just have low self esteem. I became a mute quite a few years ago after acouple of events that got me down. I think it may have been catatonia. But I'm not 100%. Ever since then I don't feel like I got back to my normal self. I'm a lot shyer and I don't have much luck socially or romantically or in my career. The best way to put it would be I lost my personality. I can really beat myself up sometimes because I hate myself. When something bad happens I really start self loathing quite badly. I don't feel suicidal. I hate myself more than I hate my life. I blame my lack of success on myself. I don't enjoy things as much as I used to so I have no real hobbies. I don't think I'm likable and I can't even pass interviews these days. I lost my personality and that's why I hate myself. I'm unrecognisable to who I used to be so I isolate myself a lot more these days. I don't think significantly depressed but I wonder if mild depression is the cause of my loss of personality? Or could it be something else that caused me to change? All I know is I've lost a lot of confidence and I'm always beating myself up about itEven if you hate them, theres something gut wrenching about hearing parents fight. I hate both of my parents. They are mentally abusive to me, and just a lack of care most of my life.	1
Sadly my awkward self didn't respond very fast and by the time my brain was able to form a "aww thank you" she walked away.	1
Does this make sense? I just feel this way about money. I feel like people think it's evil and pursuing money is evil. But you can do good things with money. And I want to do that.	1
Wtf is wrong with me :/i miss my old self i remember how easy life was when i was a youth. clubbing, would hang out with mates, went to the gym, had myself a beautiful bird, played football for my school, and made my parents proud. today? im a pathetic sack of shit who does nothing but study for uni all day and I've lost so many mates cause of it. although now that I think abt it, i don't just study all day. in addition, I've also wasted/am wasting two years of my life on this fucking website winding up people on alts on the football forums here and I fucking regret every last second of it.So I finally realized something this week... Been stuck in an episode since my birthday (just turned 25, as per my last post). Can't remember the last time I ate a proper meal. Sleep cycle is fucked. Haven't left the house in a week. Funny enough, I had planned on hanging out and doing some reading in a cafe today... only to never leave the house. All this time, I've been thinking how much I yearn to have someone, anyone, physically check in. Or a partner to cuddle with, hug, and hold me tight.... but all that just fades into the empty void.	1
My grades dropped a whole point, on average. My volunteer research suffered, and I really let down the post doc I was assisting (Sorry Bethany). My mental health took a nosedive as well.	1
this is ramble-y and i️ don’t know if it makes any sense but i️ just wanted to put it out there.Getting my BA Accomplishment in a reality that uses a perception of truth is mediocre at best. But it is an accomplishment and should be celebrated. I found a lot of like-minded individuals who only run on hope, who understand there are no absolutes. can't afford prescribed medication for depression, too depressed to get through a job app to make money for my medication im 22 and living at home like a child	1
I don’t really give a fuck anymore that people might be upset that I’d commit suicide. I definitely don’t give a fuck when people get worried when I say that I’m gonna do it eventually. It is what is. I’m not happy, I never will be. When I tell my therapist that I’ll never be happy he asks me if I can predict the future. Obviously I fucking can’t but if the last 15 years have been any indication of what my happiness is gonna be then it ain’t gonna get any better	1
Me: "Well obviously your broken arm wasn't a REAL broken arm. Mine is worse. You don't know what it's like to have a REAL broken arm".	1
It hurts so bad. I'm crying while typing this. I feel like such an idiot for believing someone would actually be attracted to me. I'm a fool for believing it and I hate myself for it.	1
I turned 22 a couple days ago and no one even said happy birthday...Not even family. At this point i'm looking at my future and its looking dim.	1
But I'm just exhausted from trying to not worry other people and not expressing how fucking done I am with everything. Is this normal? Is this healthy? Like I said, not giving up. I'm working forward. I just feel like the fake optimism is an extra step and a formality at this point and honestly complaining today made me feel better, not going to lie, as I do my best to not do that because I feel like I'm "pushing myself on others" (my situation is so bleak that people almost never know what to say in response anyway because there is nothing close to an immediate solution). But I feel angry and spiteful that people who have been given everything or that can recieve assistance from family telling me how I have to "perk up" because It's "what they do when things are hard" when their "hard" is "I stayed up all the time in college to study and it's hard" vs "I stay up all the time to study my new skillset AND risk my life every day on a chinese scooter that gives out at times to do deliveries in all of the elements to make a wage that isn't even livable, having one or more panic attacks a day because of dangerous drivers".	1
Anyone else feel like Senua/me? So fucking lonely... I've been feeling so unbearably lonely lately and it feels like it's never going to end too. It doesn't make it any easier that my roommate has been sleeping with some of my best friends and the rest of my friends are all getting girlfriends and boyfriends.	1
Your only sunbeam will be at New year's Eve, when you will travel to see your best friends. But guess what, since you have no money at all, you probably will have to work to sell fu***ng pastries, and because of that you won't be able to see your friends.	1
You’ll drive everyone away, you know?	1
I leaned forward over the handlebars, watching the patterns fly past my visions. I lifted up again, opening my voice to play a tune, looking for a face to redeem my little work. I went onward, and stared at the home that forgot me. I walked slowly up, placing the bicycle just where it was, hitting the kickstand which had sacrificed my ankle some.	1
Edit: a few people telling me if I exercise I will lose weight and feel better about myself. I only need to try it apparently. On the advice of my doctor, I have tried it, even walking. I do walk, every day, no matter how I feel. I also don't need to lose weight and being overweight is not the reason I am depressed (because I'm not overweight). Just saying to stop preaching the exercise mantra as if it's the only thing that could possibly fix what is a very real mental illness that has nothing to do with how often I move, flex or jump. My point is that it's not working.I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m so tired of my doctor telling me there will be a perfect medication.  I’m so tired of trying and it not working. I’m just...tired.  I feel like I’m not good enough and I have a hard time trying to just get out of bed everyday.  I just want to be happy. My current meds just make me feel angry. I don’t know what’s worse...  we are going to try something new and I pray it works.. I am not doing enough for my family and my therapist just says keep trying and she knows I can push out of the bad places but I just don’t have the energy to keep fighting it on my own anymore. Abnormal I'm so used to being depressed and anxious I'm amazed how people can act normally in general. I'm like how do they do it? I'm so used to feeling uncomfortable in my skin that its normal for me to feel awkward and weird in social situations. The fact that people everywhere don't have to deal with this everyday and just can "be themselves" without breaking a nervous sweat blows my mind. I feel abnormal and tired of it. This is the part people don't understand. I've met shy people and they are effective communicators once they get over that initial hesitancy of speaking. When you're overcome with social anxiety, depression, and feelings of incompetency its damn near impossible to speak or want to. Every word you utter to someone is misinterpreted because half the time its not heard or not what you meant to say. So frustrating I can't explain it but its killing me. How I feel and how incapable I am in saying what I feel. Does therapy help??? For 5 years I have had the same problems, I am socially withdrawn and really not happy. I really want to change, but every time I think about the life I want for myself it seems absolutely impossible, and I continue the cycle. Does therapy really help?She said yes! I did it, I asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes!The next 10 years will decide if I live the rest of my life I either fly or fall. Life, or death. Wake up or sleep forever. Life is shit. Please get better. struggling to plug back in throwaway. anyway.	1
I'm still depressed when people are around	1
sincerely,	1
My husband and I were separated and moved back in together. He is an addict too and going through withdrawal, so he is extra-sensitive. My ex decided that it would be a great time to blackmail me with Facebook statuses and tag my husband in them. I didn't tell my spouse about the blackmail because of the potential fallout, because things were finally good. Now I realize I just hurt him worse. Needless to say... he is pissed. It just makes things worse.	1
Spoiler: I was bullied mercilessly. If I wasn't too gay, I was too fat, or too tall, or too weird or too unpopular. You get the gist. It it wasn't my hair, it was my mannerisms; if it wasn't my high voice, it was the dark circles under my eyes. (Gee, what could have caused me to be losing sleep?)	1
The hardest part of having a job is talking. It's bad enough that I have to make eye contact. Having to speak on top of that can be nerve wrecking.	1
I've tried a rainbow of medicine, and tomorrow I increase Latuda from 20 mg to 40, and keep the trintellex at 20, per MD.	1
Anyways. Thank you. Sorry if I seem scrambled. Obviously it's an overload of processing.first therapy I just had my first ever therapy today and im not really shure if i liked it or not. I tried to be really open and talked about everything but she kinda just went over the fact that i mentioned that i sometimes have suicidle thoughts(which is like the only reason i made myselve go in the first place). Dunno why i write this here, maybe i just wanted to tell someone.Stuck living with my parents because I can't afford to leave The idea of living here forever because I can't make much more than minimum wage makes me feel suicidal. I want a cat so much due to depression and loneliness... I once had a cat I had got for my 16th birthday over 10 years ago before she died at a bit of a young age just almost a year ago. She helped me so much whenever I had suicidal thoughts; when I would get them and tell myself how much I should die, I would think of her, and then ask myself "Who would take care of her? She would be so devastated if her own master was gone. I could never do that to her."	1
I really, really want to go. But I am a coward and I am trapped.    Turning 17 in 2 days and I've never been more depressed than I am now. living is such a hassle man. feelings, school, everything just sucks. nothing is fun anymore and I just want to disappear off the face of the earth.I started doing my homework normally I never did my homework (high school) and I started doing it second semester just because. I never had the motivation so i guess i’m getting something done. Pretending I don't exist is the only way I can feel better... I like to pretend that nothing I do affects anybody. I wish that I could just do whatever and not worry about how the world around me is impacted by it, but I know that isn't true. Everybody acts like I don't exist anyway so might as well embrace it.	1
Our society preaches the fiction of hard work paying off because we need most expandable people to work hard, so that the rest can just chill and live off their backs.	1
You were once miserable, like me, you saw no light at the end of the tunnel, but then, you didn't give up. *Something* happened. Now you're happier, now you've got your happy ending, now you've got people who love you for who you are. But I'm not you.	1
To say it was a shock would be putting it mildly. I ugly cried in front of him and his hospital bed several times. I'm just so broken up for my mom and my family. Of course, me too. But my Mom and Dad were married for 45 years. And although it wasn't perfect, they had a true love. And I have such a close relationship with my mother. So when her heart is breaking it's hard for me to see. I sponge it. I feel that pain.	1
How do you get out of this funk? I don't want to feel like this and it is ruining my life. Not to mention, my SO and I haven't been doing well because of it. I just feel...nothing. I need help, but I don't want a therapist or any new diet plans. None of that copypaste bullshit. What *actually* works?	1
Stranger: thats true	1
That job I had lined up as a barista? Big joke... I met with the boss who said the store isn’t open yet and asked if I wanted to be a cashier for the university instead. I said why not, the pay was amazing at $12.75 an hour and had benefits. I did my on-boarding and was quite interested. First day on the job however they lied and put me in food service where I was demanded around by two chefs and four managers who didn’t know what the fuck they were doing. One of the chef’s actually spilt boiling grease on my foot and didn’t even apologize. The other chef was racist and talked bad about the Indian workers so much I had to leave his presence. It was a toxic environment. Income tax in Oregon was so high I wasn’t able to afford my apartment and realized I need to be working minimum wage to sincerely support myself here. I left after a month and am now struggling on finding a full time again. On a side note, because of costs and issues with finding a co-signed for a loan, I had to pull my enrollment for school as well.	1
-&gt; Go home	1
My friends say fuck her move on.	1
In an effort to help me stay on track my partner started eating the same foods as me. Weightloss had never been his goal or something he was focusing on, it was just to make it easier on me not to see him eating a toasted cheese sandwich while I was eating salad with no dressing. He wanted to limit the temptation and helped cook me awesome healthy meals that tasted a million times better than anything I cooked. For him it worked a treat, he was never overweight just a bit stocky, but hes since lost so much weight and looks amazing. And whilst im so happy for him it hurts as it just shows how much progress i havent made. As stupid as it sounds I think it highlights my weight more when we're together cause he looks so fit and healthy and I look like I sit around eating kfc all day. I want to be confident or at least more confident but I'm so critical on myself I cant even begin to let the confidence through. Any thoughts on this are appreciated and thankyou to anyone who took the time to read this.This girl I don't really know walked up to me and drew a heart on my paper I know it's something so small and meaningless but it made me really feel better. My day was really hard and some portions I felt as if I was going to start crying. I despise myself and the fact that someone can walk up to me and draw something kind of sweet and cute on my paper makes me feel less gross and insecure.	1
Perhaps unsurprisingly, this new method of articulating reality didn't win me many friends. The good ones I've retained, and those who didn't share this unearthed enthusiasm for inductive reasoning were left behind. This friendship I share with this person seems like a relic of the past me. I don't believe he's shared the same monumental changes in mental processing. He's always had a certain flair for exaggeration and fantasy, and until recently, I just accepted it as face value and dealt with the occasional misunderstandings as I'm sure he had with me. Now, however, the implications seem more pronounced. He's running a business and is constantly distracted. The time we share is often saturated by ramblings of fanatical pseudoscience or mysticism which are impossibly asserted and employ mind-numbingly irrational justifications. The only discipline seems to be that of a zealous allegiance to the fortification of the shared psychological concoctions of the hopefully ignorant. There is little point in rebuttal anymore because, deductively, the answer has already been solved for. And rest assured, 1 + 1 = 2 was not used in this equation.	0
Its not easy out there and world and parents sometimes forget how hard it is being a teen. No judgement. I hope everyone has a good night (or day, depending where you're at).I'm so tired My mood changes constantly. I cant keep up.	1
But what's worse is the moment I start thinking again is the moment all the sadness washes over me. It's like I'm in the middle of a vast, dark ocean and can't find shore. I swim and I swim and I swim but salvation is just nowhere to be seen. And I'm beginning to grow tired.	1
Anyway, as I grew older and my depression grew with me, I stopped having nightmares, I can barely recall when the last one was. Instead I have pretty vivid dreams (not lucid ones) and in most of them, I'm at some kind of weird scenery where I feel like I've always been there, and weird shit happens that I can remember, and it's like a full story, a lot of different things happen in the same dream. The problem is, in most of them, I meet someone, normally a girl, with which I start a mutual relationship after overcoming some hardship, like, my biggest desire. These dreams, as good as they sound, are worst than the nightmares because when I wake up, it takes some time to realize that I did not live that shit, that I'm still in bed, and I'm still alone.:) So yesterday was my 18th birthday, and here my dumbass was expecting it to be different than all my other ones, but boy was I wrong. It's nice to know that no one gives a fuck about you. You can cry, and scream all you want but at the end of the day, no one is gonna be able to understand you, and the deep well that has been buried within your mind. So what if you grew up rejected by every girl, guy, and person? So what if you've just turned 18 and endured waves upon waves of mental abuse? At the end of the day, when you're laying in your bed, and your demons are starting to swallow you whole and fill up the bowl, what do you do? You face it. You indulge yourself in them until the pain is numb, and you can't feel anything anymore. It may not be healthy, but it's better than suffering. Happy fucking birthday bro, have your cake.School failure I think I'm doing something wrong. I found myself in a situation where I was lucky to move to prosperous country. Except I'm 27 with no degree, no proper work experience, just some odd jobs. I'm an embarrassment compared to other immigrants. Last year I began studying for the first time since high school , just to realize the field does not interest me. I barely even understand the language. My GPA is horrible. And I can't change schools for at least another 2 years due to family. I can't even get a job because my town has almost none, and the ones it does have are given to the natives (I'm foreign). The welfare covers my expenses for now but this is not a life I want to live.  I'm also anti-social and seem to fit the symptoms of ADHD, but my therapist claims it's just anxiety disorder and doesn't wanna prescribe any meds yet.  I do have a serious learning struggle even when language is not an issue, I can't seem to grasp the concepts unless teachers spell it out for me. Basically I'm unable to learn anything the moment it goes past the basics and it's rather depressing.Do you ever go to bed planning on losing the next few days? Im about to fire up some South Park and go to sleep.  I've already planned on being useless, despondent, and out-of-touch until at least Tuesday.  I will be dead to the world.  I will not answer your calls/texts.  I will not leave my couch. I plan on hiding from everything and avoiding everyone for at least 72 hours.  I'm shutting down intentionally.  I'm making it a plan.  Fuck you, bye.No one wished me on my birthday Yesterday was my birthday and none of my close friend wished me  except for my family members. I wish all my best friends at exactly 12:00 clock , video-calling  or texting whatever suits them. I normally avoid attention and don't care about such things but this really bugs me. They are the friends that I meet everyday and had expectations , just a acknowledgement would make me happy. I know this sounds like attention-seeking behaviour and I generally don't care about such things. I am happy in under my own skin but this makes me a bit sadFinally going to doctors Put off many appointments because of my anxiety. Wish me luck Need more info about depression and other mental illnesses? I’m currently watching Kati Morton on YouTube and I always recommend her channel to people who wants to know more about depression or how to deal with it esp if you don’t have any therapist. I don’t know her personally at all! Just sharing this cause there are some things that my therapist and I haven’t discussed yet or some coping methods she haven’t mentioned to me that I found very helpful from Kati’s channel. I hope it helps you too in one way or another!Writing out my feelings in hopes of gaining some sense of catharsis I'd like to start by saying I don't think I'm a danger to myself. I'm tethered here pretty strongly by my family and my best friend. I can't see myself leaving them, because I've seen what it does to people when those closest to them go. I resent the fact that I can't go, at times, but there's nothing to be done about it really.	1
I will be exploring different topics on mental illness while trying to find ways to change the way people think and talk about it. I will not only be looking at the psychological background of mental illness, but the neurological background as well. More and more scientists are publishing articles on different alternative treatments that don’t involve medications. One of my favorite topics, which I will soon explore in more detail, is neuroplasticity, or the brains way of re-wiring itself to create new circuits, and essentially a new you. I’ve set a goal to one day create a facility for those who are afflicted with a mental illness. But instead of white walls, cold stares from employees, and isolation, they will be surrounded by beautiful colors, the outdoors, and people who actually care.	1
This even just kind of exemplified what I get sick of in people. Even if you don't "get it" why is it so hard to realize that people have different priorities from you? Especially people who are depressed or have other mental illnesses. It can be a triumph for us to get out of bed some days. If we share an achievement or (more rarely) a failure with you, be with us in that emotion for a moment. Why is that so hard for "normal" people?	1
My fathers first two children ended up like they did and then there is is me. Without my mom would I have been something different?	0
You: idk how to stay engaged	1
I resist the medical model of my mental state because it assumes the problem's with me rather than with the world. I figure I'd be okay if I had the basic level of social success normal folks have: a number of close friends and a healthy romantic/sexual relationship with one or more partners.	1
"We're soul-friends" (trying to make me agree with him)	0
Whenever I feel joy, it lasts for a minute, then I’m back in my own dark world. Very dark world. I think about suicide, screaming at people, wanting to beat some people up. Then I lay down, and feel guilty for thinking about such horrible thoughts.	1
She is type A personality and I would like to think I am type A-. I yield to her way of living most of the time til it gets to be too much. Maybe the reason I don’t do more around the house is because it will yield the same results anyway, an unorganized mess.... I at least do the basics. I pickup after dinner. I take out the trash, (this job now goes to my son). Handyman work, I fix plumbing, appliances, broken doors, tv’s, computers, iPhones.	1
QUICK EDIT: just wanna say I tried looking up this lack of side effects from cold turkey, but all I can seem to find is the side-effects of not taking the medication, so if someone has some website or anecdotal experience they can refer me to, that would be much appreciated :)Birthday Vent I haven’t celebrated my birthday for years now. The most i’ve received is a happy birthday from my family, while the rest of my family gets full blown celebrations/dinners, etc.	1
I used to be extremely suicidal in the past and I’m slowly falling into that dark pit again. I don’t know what to do.	1
I'm just so over the limit, I can't take this pessimistic life style anymore. I'm so fucking sick of this shit show.	1
So we can wake up the next day, right where we started?I wish you knew that... I feel alone. I feel like I have no purpose. Nobody understands me. Nobody understands how much hurt I go through. How it feels to feel like this. To have two faces. To make is seem like I am happy when I feel like ending it all. But I’m not that good at hiding it anymore. If only you knew. If only you knew how I feel. If you knew how I cry every time I am alone. How I cry myself to sleep some nights. How it feels to feel like you have no one. Like no one cares about you. Like no one is there for you. Do you know now why I don’t smile anymore? Why I have a bad “tone”? Why I always seem tired? Upset? Why I always want to be by myself? Why I don’t want to go out? I wish you knew. I wish I could talk to you. I wish I wasn’t so scared to talk to you. I wish I could tell anyone about my sadness. About the thoughts I have. About how many times I have thought about killing myself. About why I feel this way. I wish you would be there for me. I wish you would let me know that there is hope. That there are people who love me. That I can live. That I can be happy too. Intrusive Thoughts I feel like I am standing on a grassy hill and the blades of grass is blowing in the wind around me, the sky is turning darker and darker. I can feel it becoming colder and the rain starts. When it rains it pours. The intrusive thoughts, the little will I have left to keep myself upright, the wind makes one big push and I fall. I fall hard. The wind is keeping me pushed down as I lay flat on my back and watch the storm go by, its cold, dark and rainy. People close to me are pushed out and a large glass cup is placed over me. They can’t see I am struggling and if they do they can’t get in. How long is the storm going to stay this time? I am not sure. The sad thoughts are like my safety blanket. Whenever things feel okay the thoughts come over and hug me tight. I am constantly depressed. When I laugh or smile, it’s like putting  a band aid over a small cut. It feels better and it can start healing, but when I feel sad its like the  band aids rip off and I am faced with the hurt all over again. The mask I put on, the adhesive falls right off when it no longer needs to be on. I am falling apart yet I am hanging on by a thread. Why did I get drunk as fuck the night before my midterm? Is it because I'm depressed and I don't give a fuck about school? Is it becasue I'm using my depression to rationalize not having to study bc im a lazy fuck? but of course thats a symptom of depression. i just don't know anymore because sometimes i wonder if i'm exaggerating my depression to get myself out of responsibilities, fuck man.  wish me luck tomorrow i ugessDo you ever feel extrem dizziness and vertigo? Hello, I've been struggling with depression for some years now. The last year was by far the worst and the first month of 2018 was even worse. The last two days I felt extrem dizziness and vertigo and I wonder if this could be because of my depression and I'm also super stressed at the moment. I have to get stuff done but I can barly move without feeling the need to puke. When I lay down it gets even worse. Did anyone of you ever experience something like this? i already tried the usual stuff like drinking more water, eat something with sugar etc. My blood presure seems fine aswell.My Story - There is hope. **TRIGGER WARNING - includes graphic language.**	1
Mum's questions are relentless My mum is always asking me 'How is blahblah from high school?' 'Are you meeting up with blahblahblah this winter?' 'Have you spoken to blahblooh?'	1
Always had it but in the last three years I've been hit with health, friendship and security issues.	1
I try and tell my friends to hang out after a rough week and a breakup, and I just got blown off entirely. I’m really at a loss because no one gives a shit.	1
I don't think I have been lying to her, I just didn't told her I was seeing someone, and to be honest what was she expecting me to say??	0
Once I'm out of bed, I'm good for the most part. It's just getting out of bed that is my biggest problem.	1
Person: "Dude WHAT??? That's not how you fix a broken arm. Call the hospital, they are professionals and they use professional treatment that fixes this shit!"	1
I've really hit a new low I cannot believe how depressed I am right now, I am just imploding. I got fired from yet another job for being incompetent as usual. Usually I'm pretty good at bouncing back but this job just broke something inside me. I'm a damn failure. Three attempts at college. Flunked out after the first year. That's ok, college isn't for everyone. Try a bunch of min wage jobs. Get fired or quit with in the first month or two. I can't do damn thing.	1
After a year of trying to find ways to connect with her, make myself more attractive to her, and hoping she'd love me, I've finally accepted that she never will. We are staying together for the kid's sake, and really for mine, what else would I do, no one else could ever love me, and I doubt I could ever really love anyone else the way I loved my wife. I've accepted that I will never have love. It makes me wonder, is it better to have thought I had love, and enjoyed it, only to find out it was lie, or never to have loved at all. At this point I really don't know.I can't remember the last time I laughed. I I think I'm depressed.My Fictional Home I stared outside, and watched the cold atmosphere awake me. The sun’s rays blocked by the magnificent beauty above us all; an urban scape filling my view around me. I felt a grave sadness strike all in the same spots for my daily routine, crippling what was left of my head. I grabbed the bicycle, and went along the path to any good in my life.	1
I have never had a connection or love for someone outside my family and I have had at least 3 relationships over 2 years (I am almost 30). This one really felt different, the way she looked in my eyes and the way we talked about all our joint desires, just felt so good.	1
I'm jealous of other people who can properly comfort their depressed loved ones. Everytime, it pains me that I can't find anything in my head or say anything to make them feel atleast a little better. It eats me inside that I know they're suffering and I can't make them feel that someone cares when they think that no-one does.	1
I started last october. it's july. I have maybe studied on two or three days, seriously. the other time, I just sit at home, in a kind of weird freeze. I'm BORED out of my mind, my brain is longing for some activity, and I actually really want to be all busy and studying and feel like I have a purpose. It's like I know exactly how important it is now, and my brain is screaming at me to get my books out and start doing what I want to do.	1
I have never had manual play (handjob) I have never had oral on me (blowjob) I have never been lustfully fucked, only starfish.	1
- I hate the hours (7A-7P 3 days a week, 7A-2P 2 days a week; an hour lunch break was promised in the new hire handbook but is frowned upon by staff as a lack of commitment/dedication)	1
On top of that, I feel like I don't belong anywhere since leaving highschool. I feel like I don't have a place in college, even though I got into my first choice school. However, I am too afraid to drop out because that lifestyle seems even more daunting. I really want to go someplace where I can live out my life in seclusion and just get away from anything.	1
I envy healthy relationships, ones that I could not have, no doubt	1
I had a daughter who I love very much, and we used to be very close.  She became a reason to live.  Then 4 years ago she didn't want to live with me 1/2 time any more. She became argumentative and we fought a lot.   Last year I found out she was accusing me of sexual abuse, with help from her mom ( first wife) and therapist, which is not true. The therapist never reported the abuse, and told daughter I have NPD, which also is not true.  So I got a guardian ad litem to investigate and found my daughter was suicidal, claiming PTSD because of the alleged molestation. The lawyer never helped my daughter, sparking a slide into deeper depression. My wife and parents didn't do much to try to help.  They got angry when I begged them to step in. Suidical ideation and inappropriate attention-getting threats became an actual plan, and a way to do it without leaving the stain of suicide.	1
Looping like a gif in my head	1
When I got back from France, the seeds of my current ruin were planted. All throughout college I'd been heavily involved with a camp for kids whose parents have cancer. I did it because my dad had cancer when I was a little kid, and the people I met were all wonderful, but most of all because the only thing that gives me a sense of purpose is helping other people. It drives almost everything I do. This camp gave me a rock that I could cling to through the worst of my emotional storms.	1
This weekend really bothered me because it was radio silence, despite my check ins, and despite not asking "how are you questions". For example, we are both big football/soccer fans so I tried to talk about the World Cup. He is a huge fan of the French team which won the Cup.  Nothing.	1
I just feel so numb and dull. I dropped almost all of my friendships with people who are not in my workplace. Haven't had the motivation to talk to anyone. It just feels like a chore to me. Socializing is torturous and I get bored very quick. I can't seem to focus on any conversation.	1
There is many things I want and yet I can't bring myself to work and get them.	1
So you can go	1
The first semester of my junior year, these thoughts grew too heavy. I didn't want to be there anymore. I wanted to be nowhere, not awake, not asleep, not alive, not dead. I spent my time with people that encouraged all my doubts, and I pushed away people that cared. I rarely went to class and even if I did, I scraped by on the assignments. I lived for the moments of escape when I could go to parties and drink and hook up with guys, no matter how repelled I was by them. Outside of those few hours of escape, I couldn't sleep. I never went to the cafeteria with friends or even to get a real meal. I only ate Lean Cuisines that my parents had bought me at the beginning of the year. When I ran out, I ate solely Pizza Rolls and peanut M&amp;Ms. I didn't do laundry once in those few months and barely took showers. The only time I put any effort into my personal appearance was when I went to a party because all I wanted was to be perceived as "carefree" and "sexy," not the lazy slob that I thought I was. Even then, I wore wildly inappropriate clothing compared to what everyone else at my college wore - one time a girl yelled out to me, "You're going to get raped!" Another said judgmentally to a friend, "She's not wearing pants." (I was wearing sequined booty shorts, okay). My only happy moments that semester were with a boy that then tried to sexually assault me with a visiting alumnus. His excuse was that he wanted to get into the alumnus' frat by impressing that brother. When he tried to apologize the next morning, I told him he shouldn't apologize. I was so disconnected from my body, I didn't even view it as mine anymore. After that, I didn't blame him and still spent most of my 'free' time with him. (Free meaning when I wasn't laying on my bed trying to gather enough strength to even leave my room, going to a party or the rare occasion I went to class or very very rarely attended a sorority event.)	1
Thanks for readingI dont have friends. So i was talking over phone to my female best friend. I was sharing my problem with her i had recently. Now we supposed to hung up. But unfortunately phone didn't cut. And i was able to listen her. She was telling my thing to her roommate in cooked manner. And I came to know that she was jealous of me all those years because I was good than her in studies and anything. And she was thanking god for failing me in my recent exam. This thing just broke my soul. She was the last person i could trust. Now I am depressed af. I didnt say a thing to her till now, i hung up phone myself, when i couldnt listen more. I dont know how to react when i am going to meet her next time.I've been in a constant rush to try and get on my feet for the last three years, but I always end up doing nothing about it. I've forgotten what motivation is all about.	1
This is who I am and I wouldn’t change my life for anything in the world because now I truly understand what it’s like to live with a mental illness. I finally know what the difference between sympathy and empathy is, and that is one of the greatest gifts that could have come out from this.	1
I ask this because recently (within the past 6 or so months), my supposed 'friends' have started to become quite distant with me and it's making me feel like total crap. They rarely ever contact me despite me having reached out a couple of times. It's all very fragmented. What hurts the most is I see them interacting with their other friends (on facebook etc.) and also that they have been online recently but still have not answered my messages. My friends used to be great, they used to consider me their closest friend and would reply quickly etc. But now I feel like I have been replaced and I have nobody left. Even back when I'd hang out with them, they'd be on their phone talking to these other friends of theirs and I feel so hurt.	1
Now to me a panic attack is something manageable if you are equipped to deal with it. Through the years I have learned to be aware of my surroundings and triggers and to be prepared to deal with anything since I am responsible for my children. I have no history of hysterical or erratic behavior, so I found his reaction to my first ever panic attack very… crude.	1
Anyone else feel like this ?	1
I guess my rant is over. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.Long Winded Post From a Failed 30 Year Old I don't even necessarily want to write this but I need to clear my head. I've been a depressed pissant for as long as I could remember. Some of my youngest memories are melancholic and sickly devoid of confidence or even reason.	1
I used to deal with loneliness through friends on PlayStation but even those relationships feel like they're getting distant. I recently started talking to my former best friend from PS4 whom I've known for about 7 years but ever since he started seeing someone it feels like he's gotten meaner to me and doesn't care to be there for me in the same way anymore.	1
My grades are dropping, I'm losing sleep, and I distract myself by playing video games in my dorm room all day like the useless loser I am.	1
My Wifes Car, Money, and My Brother. What do I do? My wife and I got married, but instead of an engagement ring, we decided I would buy her a car instead. I brought the Toyota and moved in. She already owned another Honda. This way we would have 2. Eventually, she gave her Honda to her brother (who was also in need), and I told her she could give it to him because her dad had initially bought the Honda anyway, not her, so he has every right to own that Honda especially since we had 2 at the time. Keep i mind that it was ultimately my decision, not hers, to let him have the car, because although I'm married to her and her dad bought her the car, I felt like since her dad "bought" it, he has the right to it, and since her brother is her dads "male" descendant, he has the right to the car. (Sorry we're an asian family) So now we have 1 Toyota (the engagement ring car). With a baby on the way, we decided we would lease another Nissan ourselves, so we could have 2 cars again. Recently my brother was involved the Caribbean island Hurricanes where he goes to Med School, and his whole semester was shifted back to America until either this August or December. So now he's also in need of a car for about 8-9 months. I told my wife that since we are leasing a Nissan, we can let my brother borrow our current Toyota for the time being. My wife doesnt want to give up the Toyota to him in fear that she will lose it. I thought this was unjustified because she gave her Honda to her brother, so why can't I let my brother borrow the Toyota too? Both of us grew up believing in "helping" a person in need, and I feel like I went out of my way to let her brother have a car that was rightfully hers, but she didnt let me do the same when it came to my brother. But then again, I feel like she does have a right to the Toyota because it was a replacement for an engagement ring at the time. After her brother took the Honda, we have been using 1 car for the last year. I figured we could keep using 1 car for another 8-9 months if it means saving my parents some money in buying my brother a different car. Am I wrong here? Is she technically right? Am I unreasonable because what we do with the car should be my wife's decision, since it was a replacement for her ring? Is it normal for a dad to say this to his daughter? Sorry if this isn’t the right sub. Just need an outsiders opinion on this issue. My dad will often make *jokes* about my weight, for example: Tonight we were having dessert and I didn’t want any, he told me to stuff it in my fat little face. A few days ago, I was eating chips and he said I’m gonna get chubby, before that, he says stuff like “Nobody likes the fat chick” He says I’m gonna “get fat like my mom when I’m older” that’s another thing, my parents are divorced due to my mom cheating and if I’m being sarcastic towards him or anything he says “I’m gonna give you to your mom if you’re not careful.” It’s like I’m an object instead of a person? I do a hell of a lot of housework and all, it hurts to hear him *joke* about that.	0
I moved to Portland... and now I believe I’m regretting it...	1
The worst part is she sits right next to me at work. She's leaving next month to hike the Appalachian Trail, but until then, if I really did blow this, then I have to sit next to her every day for a month. I don't know if I can handle that.	1
Pattern of behaviour:	1
EDIT: No its not a cry for attention or likes or upvotes. I sincerely feel good when I see the people of /r/depression commenting on my posts, and I love commenting on theirs. A mutual feeling of belonging...Told my therapist everything. Told him about my suicidal feelings. Probably said a bit too much because I had to beg him not to call the police.	1
Person: "Really? Who did you call?"	1
You: therefore, they aren't friends	1
The night before, however, the party's promoters announce on facebook that the venue has changed to another location. A little aggravating, but not a big deal. They decide they're not gonna let that mess up their NYE and want to have fun anyway.	0
I've always had a rough time fitting at school. Our elementary school was VERY SMALL, it only had 75 kids (including kindergarden). I was always the "odd one out", but because it was so small i had 1 friend. We played alot together and it was a ok time really. but when i was 5 most people around me started to notice that i made weird random noises. And that i made small movements with my shoulders (unnatural ones). Friends got annoyed, parents got annoyed, everyone got annoyed. Eventually my teacher screamed at me telling me to shut up, RIP ME. Eventually mom took me to a specialist and it turned out i have Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, if you youtube this you will get extreme cases where people shout fuck and ass, and move uncontrollably all over the place. THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH ME. I think Tourette affected my life ALOT (it still does!!). I was always a really shy kid until i was 11, i started to accept my tourettes and was a happy 11yo. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	1
I'm ready for it to be over.	1
I know it sounds stupid, but lately I've just been envisioning my feelings as the mind flayer monster from Stranger Things because it helps me make a little more sense of everything to a degree when I envision the feelings as something physical... I just wish it was a bit easier to find the focal point/issue that makes me this way to improve not only my life but also the lives of others around me.	1
Still, sometimes when the depression gets the best of me, I think that’s who I really am. This broken, beaten down person that's ashamed of basically her entire young adulthood. I fear that I don't want anything of substance. That I can’t find anything of substance. That I don't even know what I want. No path. No passion. When it gets that bad, it takes every ounce of strength I have to fight it.	1
Despite being rejected, having finally had the confidence and self respect to ask out a woman and accept the no graciously is a major growth in my self esteem and wellbeing, so having done so I feel a great sense of accomplishment. This has really helped boost my self esteem and confidence, even though I was rejected.	1
Basically it seems like whenever I feel down, my brain immediately jumps to "maybe I should break up with my boyfriend." I don't know if this is a sign that something is actually wrong, or if this is just what a depressed brain does.	1
How do I know? Because my sister was depressed once and I've seen how everyone reacted to it. You see, my family's  never changing mentality is "we need to fight together! We are there for you (goddamn Fairy Tail guild or something)". I don't blame them and I bet there are people who'd exchange everything only to be with someone as supportive. But I have always hated attention so much since I remember my self as a kid. Ironically enough I've had the biggest birthday parties in the town to boost this 'weird' hate.	1
Ah well, can't win em all, right?  Just wondering, for those who have had lifelong depression did you ever find some joy that wasn’t turned to a sad story? I’m starting to feel that depression never goes away, you just learn to manage it. I however, can’t recall a time in my life where I was happy. I don’t even congratulate myself when I do accomplish something. I don’t allow others to either, because it doesn’t mean much to get praised for things I should’ve accomplished a long time ago. Anyways, I’m on meds and truth is, I don’t feel like myself? I don’t think any drug can make me feel myself? Depression in some wicked way has made me become the person I am today. A lot of my coping skills and defense mechanisms are still present and that makes a lot of who I am. Is it stress, depression or burn out? Hey,	1
Remember today. Take another deep breath, if you are comfortable, close your eyes. Appreciate whats around you, good or bad. Maybe the day is really ugly. Remember again that it is on around its own business. Do not see it about yourself, but instead look at your role in the big picture.	1
Does anyone have any advice for meeting new people in a non-college town? Anyone else having the same problem? I'm so lost and sad and patheticI’m an empty shell of a person I only show emotion I don’t feel it when society dictates that I should laugh or cry I do but I don’t feel happy or sad just nothing. It makes day to day things hard because I can’t emotionally connect with people and they usually end up hating me for it, I want more than anything to be able to feel something again I feel like I’m spiraling downwards. I’m losing people and can’t do anything about it or do the wrong things. I’m just searching desperately for someone to care before it’s too late. This summer has just flown by. I work so much and made the mistake of taking multiple summer classes. I spend every moment I can trying to do fun things with my friends but many times it’s not as much as I’d like.	1
Just a rant because I don’t usually see a lot of people talking about it. Sometimes I worry I let my mental illness be my excuse? It feels easy to justify staying up late, not eating properly... Not going out or not doing xyz; because I'm unwell. It feels impossible to differentiate between me being unwell and me not using it as an excuse.	1
I have a bunch of great friends, but I'm tired of being single again. I know that I should just focus on the good things right now, but it's not seeming to be any consolation.	1
I know that I should take care of myself, but I'm so tired of living that I'm hesitant to do anything for myself. What is depression? “Depression is your body saying fuck you. I dont want to be this character anymore. I dont want to hold up this avatar you’ve created in a world thats too much for me.” - Jim Carrey	1
This is an insight into my mind from many years ago when I was dealing with depression. I can confidently say that it is fixable guys. Please don't listen to people who say it is completely unfixable. You can beat it, I promise! I love you guys. Good luck. &lt;3carpe diem Today is the day for change.	1
Stranger: im full of nicotine rn actually	1
I wasn’t good for you, you were too good for me, we crashed and burned and I loved every second of it. Was it worth it? Maybe. Does that matter? Not in the slightest.	1
I do not currently have, nor have I ever had, anything even resembling a love life. I was foolishly in love with a close friend who felt nothing for me thru high school and most of college before I managed to stop kidding myself on that one. I’ve never had sex with or even kissed a girl. The closest thing I ever did was cuddle with a really close friend, and I even fucked that up because I overthought everything as always and didn’t make a real move, and she instantly lost interest/gave up on me, and now we’re barely even friends anymore.	1
And yes I have had a better life then a lot but dose that lessen my experience and hardships ? Yes I have a supportive family and yes I have friends that are willing to listen to my bullshit, but dose that really lessen my inner turmoil and trouble with my mind, so I have to be fucking stabbed by my own brother to make it legit ?	1
Am I really a human anymore? It's human to fall in love and get into relationships and have sex and whatnot with your SO. It's human to even hookup with people. I'm not qualified to be a human apparently. I bet most people my age have had 3-4 SOs, and I've had a big fat 0. Even other people with anxiety and depression can get into relationships, when other people see them, their mental illness makes them want to care for them, but for me, they run away. It's apparent in this subreddit too. Not even worthy of being spoken to from a woman. Can’t stop crying This week has been terrible, and next week is not going to be any better. I’ve been crying myself to sleep and then waking up early in the morning, only to cry more. The gross weather is not helping either seeing other people having close, intimate relationships with each other made me so goddamn sad that I had to leave. I was at a party last night with some friends, and the whole time I saw people talking and hanging out like they were best friends and had known each other for years. It made me really sad because even though I have a wide circle of acquaintances, my mental illness and my fear of rejection makes it so hard to actually get close to people. I’ve been in college for a year and a half and I still don’t have any close friends that I text or hang out with. My friends from high school are all off at different colleges living their own lives now, so we aren’t close anymore. I kept thinking about this last night at the party and I got so sad that I left.	1
Help please"I don't wanna die, but I ain't keen on livin' either." Sorry for the Robbie lyric. I just want to vocalize a bit before the rare fancy passes and I go back to soldiering on alone. I'm sorry if this rambles or doesn't quite make sense, but if I leave the stream of consciousness or reread I will probably delete because I loathe the idea of complaining to others or whinging knowing full well I've probably got it better than most people here. But a part of me wants to know that someone else experiences depression the same way, as some small solace.	1
As much as my family frustrates me, I understand that they are trying to help but they just don't know how. They have supported me financially on several occasions before now. Without their help I would almost certainly be homeless or dead by now.	1
Sorry for the long post I just didn’t know where else to turn to	1
Except I don't think that, I know that its bot like I have a bad fate, I'm not destined to never have any friends and feel this way my whole life. Its stupid to say that I am.	1
Sometimes i think i can cry, but i can't even squeeze out a tear.	1
But now I am constantly running late because deep down, I just don‘t want to go anymore and give up. I don‘t have energy for that.	1
Ok god damnit im re-reading this post, at this point im just rambling... Idk what i expect from posting this here... Maybe its just to give my empty brain a boost... I will just end this post now or i keep adding stuff.	1
Even though therapy is helping alot i still feel so lonely a lot and then i wish i just had someone to talk to... Its really hard keeping all these feelings and thoughts to myself all of the time...	1
Idk, I'm just confused and scared.Losing years at a time to depression, 27 still haven't finished 4 year degree. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to cope! At this point I have no idea how to even get back to the pathetic life I used to have.	1
I like the caprese sandwich I'm eating, with melted mozzarella, tomato, red peppers, pesto sauce.Anyone elses depression feel like this? Good day, This might be weird but stick with me.	1
Here’s the catch. For obvious reasons, his name will never be revealed. No one will have any idea who my friend is. But little by little, I will try to reveal the channel to him. It’ll start with the channel being named “Ian”, then sooner or later add my last name. As time goes on I’ll try and find ways to give him clues about the channel without actually telling him anything.	1
I feel awful about even saying that, I see the weakness in that statement, the defeatism, but that doesn't make it any less true.Psychiatrist of 6 years terminated me as a patient and is refusing refills of Lamictal because I went to outpatient rehab? I have been going to the same psychiatrist for 6 years.  I have been on a high dose of Lamictal for 6 years to treat bipolar disorder.  I have gone to regular appointments and have had consistent refills.	1
So my SO is away for work (for more than a month), but we are still in the same time zone. Lately, he's been having bad episodes, but a week ago he said he had a really session with his therapist there. (I'm proud to say that he said I was the only person who managed to convince him to seek professional help!) So, okay, so far so good.	1
Then came the cynicism. Belief that nobody out there was pure and everything they did was for their own personal gain. Suppose it’s true in a sense but I wish I didn’t have this “paint everybody with the same brush” mindset. It’s hard to believe I’m the same person at times. It’s been 7 years now and I’ve had enough. Just dunno what to do. I feel like I’ve tried everything. Can’t help but feel I’m partly responsible, for buying into the shit I told myself. Just a rant So today my parents came from NY to pick up the kids from me as I will be leaving the country for 6ish months soon.  My soon to be ex wife leaves to move back to Japan tomorrow.	1
Stranger: well longterm you can always just meet more people	1
Anyways, I know that there's no such thing as simply getting your advice on how to fix my cousins depression. I know how complex of an issue this is. What I want to know from you all is if there is anything I can do this weekend to just show her that things can get better. My little cousin has always looked up to me, and I plan on taking her out to do some of the things that she always wants to do (like go to the park, make slime, whatever 12 year olds like). But is there anything extra I can do? Is there anything that you all wish someone told you? Or maybe even something you wish they didn't?	1
I'm never particularly sad, nor do I hate or wish harm upon myself or my life or the people in it. However, in every waking moment I have a weight emanating from my core, like a gravitational pull sucking in my ability to want anything meaningful.	1
I just wish people ignored me and yet I feel lonely. I don't want to be hurt and yet I am the one hurting myself.	1
And with that, came my wake up call to get help..Do i need a high education to succeed in life? Do i really need a high education, maybe even an university degree to make much money, and don't live in poverty? if no, how can i become successfull even with low education? Or is that impossible? How can i become sucessfull and avoid poverty even with a low education? Because it makes me scared of the future and depressed. What should i do? All of my friends annoy me I try to hang out with ‘close friends’ because I know it’s meant to be good for me. There’s probably about 4-5 people I’m close to. These are all good people who I’ve known for years, who I can be honest with about my emotions and mental health, who genuinely do care about me. On paper they’re amazing. And they are.	1
Stranger: but yeah idk i promise youll feel less depressed as time goes on	1
I can't find any reason to continue with life. I don't have any control over my own life. My folks don't want rent, but they control every aspect of the rest of my life instead and every time I walk in the house, I can feel the tension and I get talked to like a child whenever I don't follow their rules. The woman I had committed my life to now practically hates me. I see no way out.	1
I have no real friends (not including work acquaintances, who all have their own lives to live) in my area, all of them are online, and again, they all have their own lives too.	1
TLDR: My friend is dating my other friend's rapist. Am I overreacting by cutting off my friendship with her completely?Trying to make me jealous I once asked some friends about where they get one of their "items" and they both seemed to shrug it off, laugh and basically show that they don't want me to know. I thought wow ok didn't expect it from friends but I guess some people are petty about some things. And they knew that it got to me a little that they didn't tell me but whatever. Now they would bring up the topic of this "item" here and there knowing how they treated me regarding it. I have strong suspicions they are doing it to spite me or prod me to give a reaction or just to reinforce their "dominant" position. They probably get a kick out of it. The problem is, I don't know the best way to react to it when it's brought up in convo to show that I'm not envious or jealous. And I'm not jealous of it at all as I actually found out what I needed to through other means, it just bugs me that they think it does and so I don't want to give off that vibe so they can go into a private convo and laugh about it.Top 15 Inspiring Friendship Quotes A friend is seemed to be a person who takes a great place in someone’s life. They share all happy and sad moments in the same manner. To make your friends realize that they have taken an important place in your life. Here are 15 friendship quotes which show your feeling towards your friends.These parents physically hurt their teenage daughter by burning her with hot oil and hitting her with broomsticks due to her refusal to marrying a man much older than her who is paying $20,000. This horrendous story just goes to show that your family isn't always this happy loving caring group of people who want the best for you. Sometimes your family can be toxic and parents can be bad at their jobs, and it's very important to know when to say no, and walk away if you can. Especially if your culture and religion like this young girl tells you to never say no to your parents and obey their commands no matter what, It becomes very hard to go against them and say no, but it is essential to draw that line for your own safety.	0
People told me 10 years ago to stick with it because it'll get better. They still tell me that even though I would love to go back 10 years now because of how much worse its gotten and how much better even that was compared to now. I didn't think it would get this bad but it did.	1
I've been trying to open up more but it's so fucking hard to do that, I've got to the point where I don't care, don't care about my life or feelings I don't care how I die, I don't care how long it takes I don't care what method , hanging , OD, drowning, train, fire  it doesn't bother me.	1
So for some months I took the addy as needed and the anti-depressant as described (other than the days I forgot). So fast forward to summer and while I'm feeling marginally better, I was lead to believe the addy was doing most of the work.	1

I am too lazy. Everything is just too tedious. In everything I do, halfway through it I just feel an intense urge to give up, and I do. I can't find a proper hobby to distract myself from whatever's inside my head.	1
They have no idea where they are going to and what goals they have. It leads to frustration, procrastination, apathy and depression. Because they have been caught in a daily routine. Day after day, month after month… No time to think, no time to plan, no time to review or set goals. In my opinion, this is the reality for 99,99% of the human population of the Earth. Is there a solution?	0

Has anyone actually outgrown their depression or mental health issues? One of my biggest fears is that my depression, anxiety, and personality disorder will either stay with me forever or will increasingly get worse. I truly feel it’s getting worse every year and I feel I will never have a normal life or be successful because of them. Therapy doesn’t work on me, and medications may work some but only for a short time. My thoughts on suicide and self harm are getting worse also.  I can't stop dreaming about having friends. I don't know why I use this daydreaming technique every single day. I can't trust real people because they always seem selfish to me. I have that weird, twisted image of having a best friend who doesn't judge me and enjoys spending time with me, but it's not real.	1
I certainly feel that i have a huge major depression. My OCD thought are back and i have been stuck on testing my blood sugar 10-15 times per day during the past year. Which also could bring my stress levels up. The past year has been very stressful for me work wise. But even if i get a weekend of rest i don’t feel rested. I have been to different psychiatrists and psychologist and the conclusion is either major depression or burn out.	1
So to start everything off, I never thought that I would be typing these words as I am now. Not to say that I'm ashamed of it, but just because I never felt I had anyone to share with. I never have felt like I was able to confide in my close friends or family because I don't want them to carry the burden of my troubles, and I used to feel like it would just be a form of attention seeking to try and explain to others how I feel sometimes.	1
Auto-pilot at work. Able to do job easily, so lack of focus is a non-issue. I spend too much time on Facebook and other social media looking for outlets to expand my social network and friends. Find it very difficult to do so without appearing over-anxious or creepy and new opportunities rarely prevent themselves. Sometimes  Imarket business and contact clients/potential clients. Sometimes a boost comes from having success here, but often the lack thereof is equally esteem damaging.	1
https://www.green-yoyo.com/home#defosMy husband is not my best friend. Friends jealous of friends. My husband isn’t my best friend and that’s ok. In fact, it’s more than ok. Yes, he is my friend but our connection is deeper than that. We are building our lives as one. Sharing our day to day, filling them with constant support and security. I love my husband deeply but we are also different people. He plays video games and I do arts and crafts. He watches war movies and I go to brunch. I value my friendships &amp; consider them a priority in a different light than the priority my spousal relationship takes. Because of our many differences, I take and make the time to build on my friendships. If their partners are their best friends, I am truly so happy for them. What a beautiful thing to find.	0
Wednesday I left work at 10am because I was too down to stay. I was texting her the same stuff throughout the day, how I was sad and I wanted to see her. She worked until 930 again and didn't come, but this time she had never promised to. I texted her this big apology about how I've been a shitty friend and I'm sorry for forcing my problems on her. At work Thursday she told me to stop apologizing for everything. I told her I would try to stop.	1

Stranger: humans created a system of working and living on less of a survival mode, which has created so much boredom	1
I dont know how i feel or what to say. I feel hurt and i feel abandoned and i feel stupid and i feel not good enough and i feel like a complete fuck up i feel so fucking awful its not even funny. Im losing my friends because my stupid brain cant get over this and im constantly going to them to talk about it because that's the way i like to deal with stuff, but they've heard the same thing one too many times and i get that i just dont know what else to do. Im tired of thinking about it, im tired of not being able to confront her but my friends say its not a good idea because its not gonna do anything but make her think even higher of herself for having fucked me up so badly and wont at all make her change her ways. I want to completely forget but at the same time a part of me wants to work everything out just so i can mean something to this person who meant absolutely everything to me at one point again, WHY?? Why does my brain, or heart, or whatever still crave attention from her, or maybe even her herself, even after knowing all of this? Why am i so fucking pathetic? What can I do to move on that doesn't involve just ignoring the problem and moving forward but rather coming to peace with it and myself and blossoming?	1

My depression came back with a vengeance yesterday during the day. At lunch time I locked myself into the bathrooms to cry and cry. I took a tranquilliser that had been prescribed for me during bouts of extreme depression to curb the urge to self harm and it did nothing. I hate myself so much. This exchange, this is what I wanted my life to lead up to, and my fucking brain is ruining it all for me. Aside from this, I had nothing to look forward to in my life. I just want to be happy, I want for people to not hate me. I know most people hate me because of the way they act around me, they won't invite me to any class activities even if I am right there, and I will be the only one not in the class group chat, class karaoke nights, etc etc. Literally the only one. I am scared of going to intercultural lounges to interact with people because they all know each other from last semester, and I can't even talk to people in real life in the first place. I just feel like an alien. I don't feel like I was meant to be born in this world at all. All I want is to be suddenly transported into a different world. I don't want to be here anymore. I just want to be asleep forever. I want to be dead.	1
Today was one of those few days I get that I don't have any class or shift. I got carried away and stayed in bed until 2pm. My mom suddently came home from work (while still at her work, don't know why she even tries to sneek out) pretty much came home to yell at me to get up and clean my room. I always think she forget that I do have depression with medication and have attempted several suicide method.	1
If there was someone who can tell me my fate i'll want to listen to it now. I just can't anymore. I fucking just want to run the bridge and jump off but sadly i recognize that I only have one life. I'm hoping and hoping maybe everything can turn around for me but what are the odds to be honest.	1
I truly deep down wish I was never born, but I would never ever commit suicide. I wish more then anything else that I can just disappear and leave this world.	1

Thanks in advance,Does anybody else go for late night walks hoping you'll walk into someone who's also feeling the same ways? I don't know why it's never even had any romantic thoughts but it's always been a female, i always get a sense i will walk into someone going through the same things and somehow we'd know and just walk together without even talking but feel okay. Maybe its just a way to cope with feeling alone, but I haven't seen daylight in a week so whether its loneliness or a sense of something to come I'll continue. See you out thereAnyone else stay up all night on their phone in bed because it feels like no time is being lost? All the time during the day, I feel like I'm wasting time, wasting my life, doing nothing, going nowhere. But at night, it's timeless. I guess I think these hours would've been lost to sleep anyways so I'm not losing anything at all.	1
Like, why am I even doing this to myself?Unmotivated to be anymore Looking at my life from an objective point of view right now I have a lot of shit to do. I have no intentions on doing any of it though. I’ve stopped solely telling myself I want to die. I don’t know if I want to die. I don’t know if I want to be alive. I don’t even really care. I’m indifferent to both options. I feel like the only thing I do care about is what people think of me—which fuckin sucks not gonna lie. I take so much offense to someone not liking me in every way, yet I’m too fucking unmotivated and indifferent to make myself better. It just leads to a cycle of people disliking me&gt;me getting sad as shit and just losing a sense of caring&gt;me being a black hole of negativity which cycles right back to the beginning.	1
‘A nearly missed accident up ahead,’ I reminded myself. I hit the button to change colors, and awaited a stop that could mean a sour tardiness or a decent morning. The color changed fast, and I hastily sped across the lines between me and the other side. I arrived, striking the pavement at full speed ahead down the rubber sidewalk.	1
Our current mental health system is completely and utterly fucked up. We can’t keep over-medicating people and throwing them out into the world with absolutely no regard for their actual well-being. If these “treatments” were actually working, we wouldn’t be seeing an alarmingly increasing rate of mental illness.	1

Everyday I wake up and I’m angry. Always wondering what the hell the point of this is. Why I’m here.	1
Thanks for reading.Depressed? Or Just in a Bad Rut? (Long Post) I've never really felt like I've had depression before. I'm turning 24 at the end of the week, and this is the first time I've honestly wondered about myself. Usually, I'm pretty happy about things, and my outlook on life has always been realistically positive. But, lately, I just feel absolutely lost. And this morning, after I got off of work, I sat and cried. I'm not much of crier at all, and the only other time I've cried in the last ten years has been at an uncle's funeral recently.	1
So whoever you are, thank you so much, and I can't express how much this meant to me or thank you enough.	1
I guess things started to slip for me when my uncle got hit with a terminal diagnosis in August. At 47, and with young children, nobody in the family was prepared to lose him. And the disease, an incredibly rare degenerative brain disease, was the same one that killed my grandmother 11 years ago. We lost him in early September. The thing with this disease that nobody in the family is talking about is that, if it hits twice within the same bloodline, there's a 50% chance that living relatives within the bloodline will get it in their 40's or 50's. There's nine of us left in the immediate family, including my mother, my brother and myself. And since it's so rare, there is absolutely no treatment plan.	1
I'm trying to re-frame this as an opportunity, but right now, it feels like a literal nightmare. I've had no energy to do anything the last couple of days and I'm really struggling to get out of this funk I've had problems with depression for years so none of this is new to me, but I'm having a really rough couple of days and think I'd like to just talk with someone.	1
No one ever notices me. I could never hold a candle to anyone else.	1
Fuck this is why I drank. the panick begins to consume me.I feel like I'm lazy I feel like I'm lazy because I have no will, desire, or energy to work. Sometimes I don't even want to walk.. and I'm tired pretty much always. It's a work out to even brush my hair. I'm physically fit, young, and given special treatment because I'm society's fit of attractive. I can't keep a job because I simply can't force my brain to do the work or I have to miss because I'm sick.. which really is just anxiety I'm sure. No one understands that I care about how lazy I seem and that it's just that I'm so tired and every thing sounds awful other than just sitting some days. I feel like I'm crazy. It just makes everything worse too. More financial problems. More people who don't understand. Substance abuse to numb. How do you guys get energy? I've started Zoloft and it's changed my life, really improving my ability to deal and not feel hopeless, but my motivation is still completely zero and I can't make myself do or care about anything. Is it just immaturity or is something in my head doing this? Just need a hug. I'm a trans gay man and face a lot of criticism online. I talk with my friends about it sometimes because it really does bother me on somedays, but because it happens so frequently, I've noticed they don't really care anymore. I haven't talked about it in a long time even though it's still going on because I desperately don't want to bug them but Jesus Christ I am losing it on my own. Tips?All my friends have left me behind My best friends at school got new computers that can run AAA games and it was my idea. They soon all got gta and im stuck with this laptop. After this things started going downhill. i wasnt getting added to skype calls, when i asked, they said "gta players only" and when i slipped in one time i asked "when are you guys ever going to play with me again" either they didnt say anything or said "i dont know" and then one of my friends said "we will play with you at school". I have school tommorow btw. This has occured 4 days ago and each day i have gotten more sad. I have been trying to cope for it by trying to find new friends (which i did but they live in other countries so its hard to find playtimes) and also contacting old friends. I have asked my friends each day if they wanted to play and they say idk or maybe. i dont want to kill myself but i dont want it to come to that. Thats why im reaching out here. what should i do? im so scared and confused.Nearly finished high school somehow And it’s weird because I don’t have a plan for my future because I never expected to make it to the end of high school. Why plan for a future you have no intention of experiencing? And now I’m stressed because it looks like I’m going to finish high school and idk what the fuck to do with myself.I just need to get this off of my chest. This is my first time posting. I’m not sure if trigger warnings are common place here, but before you read on I would like to say warn that this mentions suicide.	1
It was not until a few days ago I received an email from the girl's mother, the girl was unfortunately diagnosed with an illness that made her lose up to 90% of her hearing. However, she was recently accepted to a prestigious musical academy, and sent me the audition tape of her performance thanking me for my encouragement. That song that she performed, was the very first hymn she struggled when I first came up to her.	1
The words you said	1
*Am I wrong? I feel a little guilty for how messy this entire thing has been but Im over feeling used and manipulated. She thinks that if she "gives" me gifts and or cries and begs for me to give her another chance that I give in. I mean it this time.. Ive gone back on my word so many times with her because of guilt and not wanting to seem like a bitch. She doesnt have many friends and I was kind of her should but she always had a hard time returning the favor. Should I meet up with her and accept the gift? Or should I just let sleep dogs lie???*	0
You: friendship does too	1
But it’s my fault, I know it is. I don’t need you guys telling me how it isn’t either. You wont change my mind. It is my fault, I taught him that suicide and depression could be treated as a joke. I made it worse. I hate myself for it. I don’t know what to do. Hell, I don’t know why I made this post at all. I don’t know if I want advice, or vent, or see if there’s someone else out there who has gone through something like this. Right now he’s on a trip with his mom and dad golfing.  Golf (the activity) is one of the few things he enjoys. All I want to do is lay in my bed and not exist in the outside world for the rest of spring break. I don’t want to take any attention away from Golf. He deserves it more than I do. I just don’t know what to do anymore.	1
On the surface, I'm told I seem ambitious, fully ready to attack each day. On the inside, I feel defeated.	1
Being alone sucks. No matter what, I can never seem to make friends with anyone new. The majority of other people my age are living it up, but I can't seem to do anything with anyone apart from my family. I feel like I'm missing out on something.	1
I am studying for the MCAT currently. I don't have any problem doing so because of my extremely addictive personality, but I find that I enjoy things that take my mind off of reality. Studying, reading, listening to music or going for a drives are my favorite ways to achieve this. But the reality I see is that this world is shit. I believe that as a whole, humans are riddled with greed and selfishness that are the motivations behind MOST of everything in this world. And by humans, that obviously includes myself and I hate myself down to the core for the selfish things I have done.	1
If you feel like you've given up and don't care about anything, give this a try. If you truly don't care then you'll at least get to feel the comforting touch of another human. They say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem But it really feels more like people are a temporary solution to permanent loneliness.Why my relationship is killing me Okay, disclaimer, former relationship... but it still has a huge effect on my life.	1
Sometimes, I just want to call people out on this bullshit but I don't post on FB anymore. No possible way these people are that happy and enjoy life so much. Is it just narcissists? Or are people really this happy and get all the luck in the world?Only 7 cigarettes today This sounds really stupid but I’ve never ever practiced self control with smoking and I usually smoke anywhere from 20 to 30 cigarettes a day. I tried for the first time today to cut back and used my iPhone stop watch to try and wait 3 hours before another smoke. Drank tons and tons of water. Currently I have only had 6 today but I’m putting in the cautionary one more just in case I do before I go to bed. I dunno if it’s ok to be proud of yourself on Reddit but, that’s a cool Little win for the day in the mind of a depressive. Hope you all are fighting the good fight.	1
Hey there, I just turned 22. And this is my situation:	1
For example, she was upset with a group of her classmates because they didnt want to follow whatever she says, and she heard that they might have said something bad about her, but instead of approaching them to ask them about it, if its true or whatsoever, everytime we have meetings she will just talk extra loud and will let our whole class listen to her nonsense comments like she keeps on talking about "fake people", as if she wanted the group who said something about her to hear it and feel guilty.	0
I believe that I will make lots of good everlasting friends in college and that I will make even more friends at my workplace in the next three years. The relationships with my high school friends will only strengthen and we will be a group for decades to come. I believe all of the people I know now.	1
I just cut ties with nine people who I considered “family” for almost 10 years. Their negativity and inability to understand what I’m working towards has literally taken a huge toll on myself. ‪Friends are supppsed to support you through the good and the bad but instead I was being anchored and every time I felt I was getting out of it I was pulled back down.  ‬The fact that I was so attached to them made this one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do in my life and it took every ounce of myself to finish telling them I didn’t want anything to do with them. They don’t understand that in order for me to become a doctor I have to commit a lot of time to my studies. But if I can’t show up to something such as drinking I get absolutely torn apart by them. It’s like they hate when I’m productive but they enjoy seeing me partake in stupid shit. They’ve told me that I’m a liar and a terrible friend on numerous occasions and it’s just too hard to even reason with them at this point. Did I over react and should I iron things out with them? It’s just since I was so attached to them I don’t know how to deal with this situation. I’ve had so many good times and years with them but lately it’s been so difficult. I hate myself so much I’m self centred, I’m selfish, I’m weak, I’m annoying, I’m an idiot and I can’t do anything right. I can’t tell how people manage to put up with me. I’m so fucking useless. I’m getting tired of bashing myself up like this. Do I deserve it? Yes, I do. It’s so hard trying not to hurt myself in the worst way possible. I’m unloveable. I miss being happy with the way I am. Why does god hate me so much? It’s tiring. Has your mental illness ever resulted in failing a course or degree? How do you get over that? I may very well be failing my graduate degree right now. It is a one year Master's program and there is no time to be failing a course without failing the whole damn thing. I can't even type how devastating and embarrassed I am. Not to mention throwing away literally tens of thousands of dollars that I will have to pay back, some that my parents invested in me and supported me with. I want to crumble. I think being awake hurts. My hair hurts. Sometimes I don't feel like a real person I feel like I'm just floating through my life, but my body isn't actually there. I'm trying to make sense of everything but its just really difficult. Tried to make sense of how I feel but its just a big mess in my brain. I've no motivation. I try, but I just can't. I feel stupid and useless. I just don't know what to do. There's so much more I want to say but I just don't know how to form the words to describe it.	1
The only problem is it's my only income. I don't want my boyfriend getting mad at me because he has to support me with his shitty job for a couple of months untill my project is over and I can find a better job. I feel completely stuck right now and I don't know what the best thing is to do...I need help finding help. This is literally a cry out for help. I have no job, and I sleep on my sister's couch and I need help. I know I need therapy but have no way to afford it. I don't know where to look for it. I have no energy to pursue it. What do I Do? Where do I go? For information I live in Memphis, Tennessee. Any help at all would be great. I feel trapped in a life I don't want to live. It took a lot of time for me to consider posting here but I'm gonna be alone for the whole day and can't deal with it. So, hi, I'm just your typical British kid dealing with the stresses of College but the problem is that I'm not stressed because of college (I don't really care much for it but it's better then work), I'm stressed because of this constant cycle of: wake up, spend an hour trying to get up, be 20 minutes late to everything every day, eat, browse the Internet and sleep.	1
I then decided to tell another friend later in the day because I was feeling good after the discussion I had earlier. It went a little differently though... His first question was, "what do you have to be depressed about?!" which instantly flooded my mind with negative feelings of remorse. I tried my best to keep calm and answer his questions honestly. I explained that it's not any thing or anyone that is making me *feel* depressed. It's a mental condition I have which causes me to be in a persistent state of sadness and worthlessness. He asked me if I understand where Eric is coming from (his bipolar nephew that he sometimes mentions), and I said yes. He then seemed to become more curious and asked me many questions about what it's like.	1
But then life screws you over and suddenly your perspective on everything changes. I learned that I no longer wanted to be the person that everyone said I had to be and things that had once seemed important became trivial. I realized that I didn’t give a fuck if I had Tory Burch shoes or a Chanel bag. No amount of money could ever bring me happiness, which was clearly evident in the money that was spent on “I’m sorry” shopping trips and my therapist.	1
Has anyone else experienced this?i think i need help in my life this my first year in collge and its been almost 4 months and i haven't made anyfriends no one even likes me there  and tbh i dont even like myself i wish i was dead or just die now in car accident one week from now ill be doing my first exam in college which 99% im going to fail idk wtf im doing in my life everything seems to be going good till i fuck it up for some bs i seriously think i should die its been an aweseome ride in this fucked up world but i think my time is up wishing u all the very best in ur life and achieveing ur dreams and please dont be  a loser like me dont u dare to give up on ur dreams im pretty sure u will make it kiddos i just cant take it anymore no one like me :/ at alllll bye cruel world I'm going to stop eating. I've been trying to fill the void by eating junk food. Long ago when I was healthy my family knew me for my big appetite. My family doesn't listen to me. Maybe they'll finally notice and finally try for me when I've stopped eating all together. Maybe I'll lose weight too, I don't care if it's just water weight. I drink a ton of water anyway.	1
What kind of "lollipop moments" do you have?Are any of you on agomelatine? Currently on 30mg/mirtazapine a day, which is ok aside from how hungry and sleepy it makes me (I understand that they can be desirable effects for some people but not what I’m looking for). I read a bit about agomelatine and it appears not to have those side effects but I wanted to know how real people have experienced it before asking the doctor to prescribe it. Thanks Self-care tips? Hi Reddit,	1
Why does it matter to do things you like if you're just going to feel bad anyways?	1
I picked it up and looked around for the owner, then after entering the station found a couple of young women searching their bags and I asked if the phone was theirs. It was, and they said "thank you so much!" And I felt really happy that I'd been able to help them, like, I just kinda decided right then to forget about my problems, because, I'd helped someone. Like, maybe those two would have never found their phone if I hadn't come along. I mean they probably would have, but, y'know. I felt like I'd been helpful in a real small but meaningful way and that felt good.	1
And then I have to go home. I am no longer in the company of people who love me, so I start feeling anxious. I start believing they actually fucking hate me. I lose it. I hate being alone because my horrible thoughts are a lot easier to hear over the silence of no one talking. When will this inescapable wait ever end? I feel as though this is never ending and nothing good will ever come out of it. I’m underserving. I have both a long-term mental illness and a long-term physical illness. One’s willpower is limited. I struggle everyday both physically and mentally/emotionally. It’s been years. My physical illness affects my mental illness and vice versa but they are offend uncontrollable! I suffer from chronic low self-esteem due to my illnesses. I don’t know I just feel hopeless and helpless. My willpower feels drained. I don’t know how much longer I can keep holding on. It’s not holding on that’s difficult. What’s difficult is holding on when there may be no meaning to it. What if I hold on with all my will and I find out there’s nothing to it. My whole life would’ve just been meaningless suffering. I keep trying but sometimes it’s really hard and I’m scared and lonely. The Beauty In Community Hey guys I recently started a new Instagram account (@skenxis) based solely on forming an environment and community for people that struggle like myself, my dream for this account is to have a very active following that doesn’t even have to be big I only wish for people that take time to look at my posts, talk to each other in the comments with support and even dm as I’d be willing to sit down and talk to anyone of you. It would mean the world if you could like or follow. 🖤 -Josh. is it bad that i want to be watching the news one day and see my dad was in an accident and died because he was driving drunk, that’s how much i hate my dad The Irony of Loneliness in an Overpopulated World As I spend more time in the presence of depression, I've tried to apply a further focus to understand what's actually going on in my head. Dealing with the sudden appearance of depression has been a nightmare and a half to deal with to say the least. So in response, I regularly attempt to interpret the spiral of self loathing thoughts and whirlwind of emotions that march throughout my mind.	1

I wish he knew I don't hate him for what he said to me and that my suicide attempts weren't to make him feel guilty. I genuinely wanted to end my life.	1
With that being said, I feel as if I truly hit my lowest of lows about an hour ago and the sad thing is that I cannot really describe the feeling... because all it felt like was just a severe sense of nothingness. I felt as if I was experiencing an out of body sensation, and my mind could not calculate any sense of emotion besides this feeling of dread that was accompanied by a warmth-like feeling starting from the back of my brain and slowly taking over my head.	1
Thanks Trinity, that was really nice, it really did make me feel better.I don't know what my problem is Hello, I've never posted here before. I'm a 28 year old guy and have a decent job that I like, it's quiet and involves a lot of puzzle solving and I'm pretty good at it. I've never had a ton of friends because I'm very particular and not very open with people so it takes a long time to build up relationships, but the friends I do have are outstanding and I wouldn't trade them for anything. I'm kind of the funny guy but my humor is very blue. I got bullied a lot in grade school and learned to make people laugh because it'd get them to not make fun of me. I think it just kind of stuck. I don't know if any of that information is really important, just wanted to give it in case that's something that people do here.	1
Sorry for the rant. TL:DR: finding myself in a rut I just can't get out of and have lost interest in lifeDropping out of college? I can’t find the point in my classes, the confusing and silly assignments they give. School was never my thing to be exact, I did decent but didn’t really ever try to get super good grades. That kinda thing just seems silly to me. Salute to everyone in school or college, I hope your doing well.	1
I had a really good therapist but she suddenly quit due to illness.	1
Even with my friend’s boyfriend, we knew his intentions from the start. My crush and I are both girls, however, so I suppose that changes things a little (we do live in a heteronormative society). With all that said, I’m pretty desperate, as she’s graduating soon, and I really don’t want to miss my chance. She's completed all her subjects and is currently only working on her dissertation. She's often in the student lounge, doing work - though I'm not sure what her schedule is like and what days she's in campus. Please help with creative ways to approach my crush (like my friend's boyfriend did)! Thanks!How to Make Friends When No One Likes You A little background, in 4th grade my teacher would encourage bullying me (she got fired the end of the year) and I pretty much grew up taught it was okay to be bullied, so I never learned to stand for myself. That obviously left a lot of scars, and my depression (diagnosed in 7th grade) makes me isolate myself a lot.	0
I really don't feel I deserve what I have in my life. Like the organ donor program I feel I'd want to give my body to someone else. Maybe they can make better use of my fully functional legs. My vision. Ever see those people do an absolute fuck ton of things with their life? Those people who are so driven to accomplish a b c d e f g... Every day of their life and they only have 1 limb? Are blind? Live in abject poverty?  I have NONE of these fucking hurdles. I, in fact, don't have anything anyone would legitimately call a hurdle in life and yet I feel depressed.	1
Stranger: id dprobably just go into a homeless shelter or something	1
I just feel so alone...my kids are gone...my marriage is done (im actually happy about this after months of depression)...and the person who i had started to grow closer too said we cant really hangout (probably) before I leave :/.	1
**HIGH SCHOOL** (from 12 to 18yo, its devided in 6 "classes". This is where the problems started, when i just started high school i was scared but excited like everyone. Unfortunately for me i got the SHITTIEST bullies in my class. I had no friends in year 1, they made fun of me becuz of my tourettes (i didnt tell them becuz they wouldnt understand). It got to a point where i just smacked someone on the head with a baseball bat. Teachers knew of my situation so we both got 1 week detention. I was "depressed" during that year, you know the teenage life, its hard. Year 2 they changed me to another class and they were OK. They didnt bully me but they didnt talk to me either. They just left me alone really, during those 2 years i had 1 friend who i talked with but he also had his own friends. So most of the time i was alone. But that friend had no common interests, so i ended up playing runescape all day, u can talk with other players there and i had plenty of friends in there. It felt awesome to have friends and i spent all my time there neglecting my studies. But somehow i passed  the first 2 years lol.	1
I'm 30 years old. I've no education. I have no passions. I used to enjoy writing but I can't bring myself to write anymore. The moment I try I go back into wounded animal mode. No, this isn't good enough. Nope, neither is this. Why bother? Why try? I can't help but think these things.	1
I’ve been talking to friends and family but I still feel crappy. The one and only thing I want to and have a will to do is to listen to the music all day and space out in it. Everything else is boring, draining and dull. And I receive no mental pleasure from doing anything else.Im just one water molecule in a sea of depression Nothing feels worthwhile to me anymore. Things I used to enjoy are depressing. Talking to someone about it is incredibly depressing.	1
Today I found by mistake a bag of women underwear with panties in My home I left it open so he’ll know I saw it. Should I confront him ? What should I say ? I’m really scared 😟 Help me figure this out So I’m a single mom I left my boyfriend because of us arguing all the time. He has my son two days out of the week and for his birthday I gave him three to be nice (there’s a reason I don’t want him having more bc he can not handle stress) but when he dropped my son off he told me he now wants him for a week meaning I have my son one week and he gets the other but I don’t want that because I think it would be too stressful for my 10 month old so I told him I’ll take him to court which the father does not want . Things have smoothed over but I still want to go to court so this arguing over days will stop but I do not want to fuck myself over due to not having a job . I live with my mom and have a stable household but having him 5 days out of the week it’d be hard for me to get a job that will work with me . If we go to court I’d allow him three days that way I can get a decent amount of work time but if I go to court without having a job or a car would that fuck me over and give the father more time ? Any thoughts or insight would greatly help and be appreciated 30 mins ago i found out my mom(47f) has 6Months-1Year to live My mom has kidney failure, she just started dialysis. I(20f) dont know how to deal with it, i dont know how to feel about this or what to do. I just wanna break down and cry but i dont wanna make her feel more stressed or feel like everything is her fault.	0
Stranger: u still there?	1
WTF is wrong with me... I haven't worked in 5 years, I live in a property owned by my parents and live off 1000 dollars a month that's from settlement from an accident (it will end very soon).  I go weeks at a time without leaving the house. I spend every day telling myself I will do a little home work and then reward myself with some kind of self care but instead I spend all day every day doing nothing and intentional wasting time until its time for bed. I dont know why I do this and I hate myself for it.	1
Unable to find a single thing in life I'm good at, and therefore enjoy.	1
This summer has already just been shitty, but at least my friends are around. It’s like fall is just a ticking time bomb at this point. No matter how hard I try to talk to someone new it never goes my way and I’m always left on read or stood up on plans.	1
TL;DR: I have a bad personality and I want to find a new one that is better.So tired of thinking about suicide and being sad I feel I want to die to rest I wait and wait and wait but this time my sadness and anxiety doesn't go away. It physichaly pains. I hate myself for crying publicly every day at the street or cafés. Sometimes I think that an angel will appear to help me for being crying so much. Writing it here is the only thing that helpsDo you ever wonder In another life, in the past or future, you're living another life, as someone completely different, and their smile lights up the room and they're secure about themselves and the people around them, and they're lucky enough for things to come easy to them, and they're nice and beautiful, but of course not, you're here and only have the one life you're wasting.Gets worse by the day lately Lately... the depression has been getting worse as each new day arrives. It’s getting to the point where I am afraid of my own mind and thoughts. Lately I’ve been hoping that i don’t wake up from my sleep. In the past six months, I’ve lost two people that I loved so much. One was my best friend of 8 years, we dated for a year and broke up but remained friends until about six months ago. He started to ignore me out of no where. Tried my best to talk to him but... he was the cause of why my depression spiraled back so bad that I almost took my own life. Then I met another guy about 5 months earlier... he liked me, I liked him, I fell in love with him. He knew of my ex/best friend and what he did to me. Guy number two said he wouldn’t do what guy number one did to me... and now I feel like he is doing the same exact thing that guy number one did to me... we haven’t talked in two weeks. I know two weeks isn’t that long to not talk, but... seeing as guy number one didn’t talk to me for two weeks... I can’t help that guy number two is doing the same exact thing and ignoring me and somehow I will lose him as friend. Sadly... I fell really hard for guy number two...	1
I can't do anything now because third wife will get 1/2, and parents are too old to deal with my belongings. My thoughts turn to seeing if I can find someone else who will love me anyway, or giving up. I want to give up but not really.  I really want to live, but I can't see any hope. And I can't stand the thought of being alone.	1
There's no one else I'd ask. Everyone at work is either dating someone or I don't know them well enough. I'm taking online classes so no one there either. I don't do anything outside of school or work.	1

I will only get out of depression when I know I deserve it.. when my life has no problems and then I'll know that there's no problems on my life...how do you make friends? i have aspergers so by default I'm socially autistic....but......theres 2 others at work with aspergers and they seem to do just fine. as far as I can tell from overhearing my co-workers...EVERYONE has hung out with others from work........not a single person wants to hang out with me. i'm not THAT ugly.......how do people do it? every year since high school (a decade ago) on my birthday cake candles...I'll wish for a friend....but nobody ever wants to be more than just an acquaintance, or to hit me up if they need something I can do for them. I'm coming to the end of my rope........I've always tried to keep a happy persona about me because I know nobody wants to hang out with someone who is 24/7 sad and mopey....I try to be funny......but I just don't understand what I do  wrong....I'm a hardcore gamer and the other gamers don't even want anything to do with me	1
I feel like she's getting worse and no matter how hard I try I can't help her or make her seem to care.	1
After that initial blow, my parents eventually gave me more freedom, I met and got involved with a guy that got me more into substances. He was going through issues of his own, which is why I connected with him. One morning, my parents tried to wake me up but couldn't. No need to go into further detail, but it was one step forward and two steps back (I no longer wanted to be 'nowhere' but was now using... alcohol... frequently). Despite alcohol being one of my main coping mechanisms, I was fortunate not to develop any dependencies or addictions.	1
Until 3 days ago, I met a girl. "Perfect stranger" is the word that would suit her the most. My situation with her is exactly like in the movie "Before we go" by Chris Evan. 2 strangers meet each other out of 7 billion people but they would never see each other again. And 3 days after we met ( we hung out everyday for the last 3 days), she is gone. We still keep contact but I dont think i would ever see her again ( please dont ask why). She knows about depression. She made me make a promise to reach out to her every time i get depressed.	1
Stranger: and those are worth living for	1
Now,apart from feeling useless and generally thinking that i have no future. I simply don't have any motivation.	1
Family stuff happened and those wounds in you festered and festered. No one knew at the beginning. You hid it well under your sleeves and at the back of your eyes.	1

But I want to be dead. Every time I see a train go by I want to jump so badly. I know my boyfriend and family would be sad but they would get over it. He would get a better, non depressed girlfriend so he doesn’t have to deal with my shit anymore. My dad has a new daughter he treats better than he ever did me. My mum would be devastated but I don’t know if I can hold on just for her sake.	1
Stranger: friendship doesnt	1
Well today, he blocked me. He blocked my phone number and he completely blocked me on all social media’s. All because he got tired of listening to me talk about how I feel. I told him today I wished I was dead and I felt all alone. And he blocked me. Maybe he really doesn’t care if something happened to me. Do therapy sessions work? I’m 18F, I’m really unhappy with existing. I constantly feel low, I have no social life or friends, even when I did - I had no interest in going out. I’ve recently gone through a breakup and it’s made everything worse, my heart feels like it can’t take no more. And I’ve got classes everyday which I don’t want to do. I’m just sticking in it for the last 6 months.	1
My boyfriend is amazing and supportive but I know this is putting so much strain on our relationship. I'm trying so hard but I feel so stuck.	1
Would anyone care?	1
Finally he was recovering and they told her she can go home since they're transferring him to a hospital closer to us. She comes home and the next morning we find out he died in his sleep from a heart attack. After surviving all the surgeries, he dies alone the same night my mom went home.	1
The plane flew slowly away, as the shock went away from my skull, as my heart was left with a small hole. I sat and could not breathe, only feeling a great pain as we jumped into the chair of obnoxious actions. I sat and thought, glancing at the broken mirror. It was me.Why does it feel like I want to be depressed? Idk, just something I've been thinking about lately and idk why. Sorry if this is offensive to someone.	1
Is it bad that I want them all to move? I'm in my room most days when they're. I feel so trapped here, and I don't know what to do. I have no choice but to stay here until I find a job for people like me with chronic health issues - and they're never going to move because they constantly mooch off my mother.  She pays for their car accidents, their bills, their car rentals, their groceries, dinner, gives them money to go on dates and gas to go drive to work (even though they make their own money), etc.  My mom is starting to sort of agree she even wants them to move, and she won't step up and say anything to anyone. I tell her to or else I will. She goes "NO DON'T!" She's so afraid of these people -- and losing her grandkids.	0
While I wallowed in self loathing, I have costed my mother so much money. Once my sister started college she had to cash out her 401k to keep us both in college because I didn't get a scholarship and didn't graduate. I would get a job, but I don't have a driver's license and public transportation doesn't go by my house. When I drop out of school my student loans will come due, and if I can't pay them my family will try. The only way out I can think of is death. My student loans are of a type that are forgiven if I die, so my family would save more by just paying to have me buried than to pay off my debt.I can't stop crying. My mom is one of the only people in my life that cares about me. We just fought over stupid shit and I feel so alone. I just broke down, and she doesn't know how to help. She locked herself in her room. I'm so alone. I want to die to bad. All I do is work and sleep all day like a zombie. I can't take it anymore.Looking for an opinion So I have been angry for awhile now, and I feel like my anger is unjustified. A few weeks, I told one of my close friends that I had feelings for her, and I also told her I wanted some space to get over these feelings. This is because I couldn't be with her. She has a significant other.	1
Sorry for formatting, I am on mobile and writing is not my thing. I am more of a numbers guy.........sometimes i hate myself and its really hard to fight some times i can ignore it but other days i really am struggling lump in throat Whenever I'm feeling really shitty and suicidal, I'll get this feeling like a pill stuck in my throat for weeks on end. Does anyone else get this? I failed to kill myself on the Friday the 13th of July 2018 DAE not tell anyone about their depression for fear of being called an attention whore? When I was a kid I was constantly getting called an attention seeker or an attention whore, mostly by the wonderful folks on r/teenagers, and know I’m not honest to anyone about my depression because I’m afraid I’ll come of as an attention whore and I don’t deserve to get help. DAE relate?Am I depressed? Or is this just my personality? The littlest things get to me. A small criticism here, a misread facial cue there. Most likely I'm reading too much into things but idk how to change my way of thinking. I dwell on them. I can't let them go. I can sulk for weeks on what a regular person would forget in an hour. Does this sound like depression? Or has my confidence been so damaged that this is just how I percieve the world now? Because of these percieved inadequacies, my thoughts have begun to worry me. I don't want to hurt myself but I feel like I'm teetering on the precipice of having one bad enough day to push me over the edge. Therapy scares me as it puts a giant "DAMAGED" stamp on your forehead but at the same time, I can't do this on my own anymore. I'm not really looking for a fix, I just want to know I'm not alone.I was rejected &amp; I feel great Last night I asked a close friend of mine on a date and was rejected, but strangely enough I don't feel dejected but rather proud and accomplished.	1
My dad who has been in and out of my life. Mostly out prior to this. Invited me out to come stay with him and his family in LA while I tried to get myself together.	1
I finished up a relatively escapist story the night prior. Stupidly, I had allowed myself to suspend my disbelief and got sucked into the plot. The writing wasn't even terribly good - the only reason I enjoyed myself was because I could temporarily forget my current self and take up the role of some other more relevant and admirable character.	1
I am going to have money and power but I don't know how to use it to help myself.I just don't know how to deal with this shit anymore. I can remember being depressed and having anxiety as early as 15 years old (31 now). I'm sure I have been happy some time along the way but I can't remember. I think most of the "good" times were just when I had enough energy to pretend and delude myself and convince everybody around me that I was normal and healthy. Unfortunately, as time has gone on my times of stability have gotten shorter, and my major depressive episodes have only gotten much worse, and lasted longer.	1
FYI,	0
Best moment to have anxiety It's 3:30am, I'm tired, want to get up early, and guess what ? My brain decided this : Instead of sleeping, why don't you become half crazy, thinking about your future (should I say the "lack" of future ?). Here, have some cravings for cigarettes, my pleasure, and of course i know you don't have cigarettes, do you think I'm stupid ? The middle of the night is the best moment for thinking of smoking when you can't smoke.	1
I mean I can get up to do things that I like on a good day like painting, but for the most part I lay in bed all day. I don’t want to feel like a nasty bitch of that I’m an “unkempt” girl but at the same time I feel like I can’t help it. I also don’t want to feel like I’m using this as an excuse to be nasty but I just can’t.	1
Wrapped in self doubt enmeshed in the brain Darkest depression succumbing again Waiting the hour, the string snaps inside Length of a second to take my own life So it is promised I do not believe Anything better than what I have seen Out of this body, I wait for this day In this hell were in, entangled in pain	1
All I wanted in that moment was for her to say "I'm sorry your pie didn't turn out, it'll be okay." Or just something a human being with emotions would say to their upset daughter.	1

Summary : I'm a 19 years old dude , NEET at the moment , life was never hard or cruel to me . Don't have many friends but all the friends i have are delightful to me , also my family puts no pressure on me and they are pretty positive overall . The only trauma i experienced so far was the breakup with my ex , but i moved on totally forgot about her . Just an ordinary life in general	1
You: usa	1
She is currently pushing me away again, so I asked to take her out to dinner the tomorrow, no response . I won’t give up on her but I want to make sure the next moves are in the right direction . I want to walk by her side thru this journey . I won’t give up on her either . So any insight on how to be a good friend during a depressed state of mind would be amazing , thank you Who am I? I feel like I don't have any defining personality. I'm either the shy person who gets on with what their doing, the social guy who wants to be friends with everyone, the autistic piece of shite nobody likes or just the normal guy. All of those personalities are just fakes, I know that, but underneath that, who am I?It doesn’t go away with love. Depression continues to exist even when you think you have found the love of your life. I look at my partner and see the sun. I am looking through foggy lenses, though. Some days I feel so lonely I can’t stand it, even while holding the hand of the best person I have ever known.	1
Stranger: i always have a backup plan as to not rely on them for happiness	1
Is anyone else like me out there? Does it ever get better? I’ve come undone I’m constantly tired, lack care for anything and suicidal thoughts rush through my head almost everyday. My depression is negatively impacting my relationship. She understands what I’m going through and try’s to be supportive, but I constantly make actions that push her away. I enjoy hanging out in groups so I can just fade away without anyone really noticing to much (compared to one on one). I really can’t live like this. Things are far from the worst they’ve been but i can feel things sinking and sinking. When I feel things going up it just ends up sinking further.	1
What can I do to help him until he can see his therapist next week? I want to leave but I am so scared he will kill himself if I do.I wish my family stopped loving me If nobody cared about me I could final kill mysefl without hurting othersThis world just isn't for me I'm scum. Bottom of the barrel. I'm no role model and I don't try to become one. Death is scary but it's the only relief from the burden of having to change. Finally got a job, but don't really care. So, finally after about 10-11 months, I got a job. The job isn't a bad one. Quite the opposite, actually.	1
i've always hated myself. always. i'm aware its probably internalized whatever from however many years of violent bullying and social isolation, but its to a point where my gf and roomate can see. i'm trying so hard to work this job and i'm smoking so much weed to cope and i get so anxious and have to talk to all these people and i'm always doing something weird and all i want to do is play Melee because its how i decompress (i do music as well but its shit), but i've developed thoracic outlet syndrome i guess from chest breathing for years and now my scalenes are fucked and everytime i play Melee i start chest breathing and i can't do the one thing i really want to do and i know thats pathetic, i can't quit my job because we need rent, i don't want to leave because i need health insurance so i can start going to therapy and possibly start physical therapy because my posture (forward head) is fucked. i don't talk to any of my friends. for some reason once they're not physically there i can't be a good friend. i lost my original best friend that way, socially defective. all i have is my gf and puppy and roommate and i flucuate between 'splitting' on them (because i possibly have bpd) and desperately wanting to avoid having them seeing everything wrong with me, they're all i have.	1
I've compiled a list of why I quit. Here's a short sample:	1
This didn't really bother me much as a kid, but now that I am 22, it is getting worse and worse everyday. Because I do online schooling (which was not what I intended) , I have little to no interaction with peers and my schooling is basically sitting in front of my computer at home. I feel completely trapped. The bedroom I share is completely cramped, and usually one of my other siblings is in it. In the living room I am surrounded by distractions and other people, with absolutely no privacy. It is hard to study or focus on anything. I feel like I have no space to myself, like there is nowhere to go. I often feel extremely anxious and depressed, and feel as though someone is cramming me into a box. This makes me just want to cease being conscious. All I think about is how badly I need to move out. Every night it is getting worse and worse, until I decided to come here tonight to post.	1
So how do you talk about this in a way that seems... I don't know - like - valid?  I don't know what to say.  I've been depressed and unemployed for over a year and now I have a friend calling me and I know that I should talk to them (I even *want* to talk to them - like they're awesome and I really really want them to be in my life again) but the thought of trying to explain myself - it makes me feel sick and disgusting to even contemplate.  What would you say? Does anyone have any good answers to this?	1
I'm writing this because I'm in it now - in the Fog - and I'm lagging behind in life. Does anyone else feel this way? Does anyone know how to get out? I met up with a girl yesterday for the second time And it was great.We went Iceskating and during it she held my hand for no reason.Afterwards we we drank some Punsch and laughed so much.When she said she had to go I kissed her and she actually kissed back.We're both depressed and for the first time in so long I feel happy.If you care, will you read? My depression has gotten really bad over the last 2 years, and today I realized something. I don't have anyone. Everyone I talk to, people I'd call 'friends' don't really care. They only notice me when I'm the one who talks first. I make plans with them, set up so much and help everyone around me, but none of them care. I skipped school to see what would happen, and nothing. No one even noticed. My parents hate me, and I'm alone. None of this really matters, and no one cares. I'm just so tired, and I want it all to just end.	1
This was my best friend, and my stalker, who for years wanted to be with me, have a family with me, worried I wouldn't want her because of PCOS, and got jealous over people talking to me on Twitter, and kittens!  She couldn't even handle me showing up with chocolates and flowers! All that I've done for her, supported her, sacrificed for her... and this is how she treats me.	1
I barely talk about my feelings I feel so isolated from my friends and the mask is slipping, i want it to slip in a way so they see the real me.	1
I feel like a bit of a failure.  A blind labradoodle could do this job haha.	1
\- His Instagram and Twitter bio is "Have fun. Be kind. Die." (!!!!)	1
Some days are bearable, but some days I just wish i could stay in my dreams all day. Sleeping, no hurting. Just.... peace...	1
Wake up in the morning with immediate feelings of depression and loneliness. Acute feelings of being alone in bed, uncomfortable. Become compelled to flip through Bumble, Tinder because I feel a need to try and immediately correct the problem. I never (and I mean never) match. Have to fight urges to immediately abuse addictions like porn and weed. Sometimes do, sometimes don’t. Prepare for work, fight off feelings of sadness about ex-girlfriend and situation it puts me in. Fight the urge to blame her for the failure of the relationship even though I logically know I’m wrong or that’s not fair. She just left to pursue school and had to move on, she didn’t do anything to me. Fight feelings of rejection and feelings of inadequacy in my value to others even though there’s no reason to feel that here.	1
I never told my parents I love them and i don't  think I have it in me to say it I don't  know why. I want to show them. I am think of writing a letter to each of them and saying it in that.	0
**I FUCKING HATE IT!!**	1
And lucky me gets to relive all of this on Valentines Day tomorrow.	1
I go to school, but it "feels" like everything just passes around me, like i don't exist.	1
But the question is if I’m stressed, have major depression or simply burnt out.	1
It's frustrating and lonely.	1
Fast forward to this year, I was able to date a couple more girls, had a good time but they all ended too soon. I've never been able to have sex with the girls I've been with because I lost my sex drive in the course of these last years. Also the extremely low self esteem and self hatred don't help. Today, I find myself unable to even have a conversation with someone, mostly girls. I can't come up with anything to talk about and I feel like all the things I learned about social skills have gone away suddenly. How do people have such natural conversations with one another? How did I manage to do it before? I feel like I want new friends, I want to have a good time, but can't figure out where to go, or what to do to achieve that. Regarding my studies, this year was a slow one. In the time I should have completed 50% of my career, I only completed around 20%. I started visiting a psychologist because I can't get myself to study for my exams (I'm not cooperating much with him), and all I do is worry about it though I never take up the responsibility.	1
I like having a picture of a God who constantly forgives and is deeply saddened by our unhappiness that becomes to hard to bear for some, versus a picture of an angry Colonel with zero mercy.	1
I can’t kill myself, because then I’d kill my whole family. My mom straight up told me if I kill myself that will be the end for her too. I don’t know what to do then. I guess slowly shrivel away or hope I get ran over. I’m trying to get communication back with my best friend. I have an idea, it won’t be easy and it may never work, but it’s worth a shot? Long story short: I’ve been depressed and I have a friend. I could make a 5 paragraph story about my friend and my depression. But I want to get to the point. I don’t want to make this post too long otherwise no one will read it.	1
I was on Zoloft for a short time (age 11-12) and it made me a little less depressed but caused me to do horrible things impulsively, act spoiled and stuck up, and have frequent fits of rage. I attempted suicide within the first month of taking meds. I developed anorexia, made poor sexual and financial decisions, and was fired from my Saturday job as a babysitter because I was yelling at the kids, teaching them how to swear and bragging about it to other teachers, and trying to flirt with the children’s fathers. At school I told everyone I had superpowers and raged at them when they said that my superpowers were not real. I had arguments with my parents and pulled out a knife to threaten them at one point. I had a boyfriend but was still flirting with other boys constantly including my teachers. I tried to “rapebait” by going into the house of a suspected molester/murderer/drug dealer but was stopped thankfully. After going off meds I crashed and burned HARD. I’m better now however as this was 5 years ago. I cringe whenever I remember it however.Why does it take some 6 months to recover, some 6 years, and some never? I know it's because we all have different brains, mental illness affects us all differently. I know some illnesses have no cure.	1
You hate yourself for being sick	1
I talked to my roommate/best friend (Samantha) about it Friday night. We agreed I needed to just leave Amy alone for the weekend, so I texted her and said if she found any free time I'd love to see her and then I didn't contact her again until yesterday at work.	1
I'm still married and that is the only reason I haven't killed myself. I did try early on because of relentless hounding from my father in law. It is obvious I'm not what he wanted for his daughter. I can't figure out why I'm alive at all. I can barely live my life.	1
I know this probably doesn't make sense, it's just word vomit. I just needed to write it down. Just feel lost and alone right nowI'm posting because i need to scream. I cut because i need to hide. i drunk and cut my head. i dont know how i'll explain. fell over i think. got in a fight maybe. no one would fight me, but i cut my head somehow. i fell and hit a kerb. no one needs to know - no one will care. i need to be more careful of kerbs. when i drink it doesnt hurt - i dont need to drink - im at university i have to - the pressure is too much. so many thoughts - i didnt need this - i didnt need to explain to people but i have to. i have to cancel other plans - how can i explain a cut across my head. this is my fault. no one elses.Anyone else feel bad for their parents for having to deal with a depressed kid? I’ve been feeling so bad for my parents lately. They try so hard to help me and spend so much time and money on getting me medicine and therapy. But still, I always let them down and show now sign of improvement.  I’m such a disappointment both to me and those around me.	1
And that's what another member tried to pin on me. He or she quickly went into offensive and started preaching about how selfish it is to want to be in a relationship if you're depressed, how I should go seek therapy and that I should realize that relationships aren't a magic cure.	1

Everything is always about her, she's even more depressed than me and has none of the coping skills I do so most of the time it's just her bringing up all her problems and me trying to reassure her.  If I try to talk about my issues though she pays no attention and changes the subject.	1
I just want to stop filling my life up with these people, trying to make myself feel better in the moment. I keep craving what happiness they give me, because I'm just so fucking tired of feeling like a sad, unless piece of shit all the time. It's  an addiction and it's ruining me.Consequences of being hospitalized? What are the legal ramifications of being hospitalized? I’m sure it goes on some kind of record somewhere but like where and who can see it? Employers? Do I lose any rights? I shoot targets for fun a lot, it’s one of my few hobbies, but if I’m hospitalized do I lose my right to own a gun? Any other things that happen that I’m not aware of? I’ve been suicidal all week lied to my dr about it because I’m afraid to be hospitalized. But it’s getting bad, I have a hard time thinking about anything else. Help please!Even if someone says something nice to me, I can't bring myself to believe it was genuine. I can't wrap my head around the idea of someone actually believing anything positive about me. To me they must be doing it out of pity. Depression is like a filter. Any incoming stimulus is just turned into something negative. I made it so much worse Hey guys, haven’t been on reddit long, or this subreddit either. Never intended to post something, but recent events have changed that. So, I’ll start with some background,	1
However, it all went downhill. My host family is incredibly lovely, I had made a couple friends on social media before even joining the university, and there were so many intercultural exchange opportunities to join. Yet, despite this, I could feel my mood slipping gradually. I have always been a shy person and not good with strangers, but I began to feel a creeping anxiety looming up on me, that told me to not bother others, that by interacting with others I was causing them inconvenience and discomfort, and the best thing for me to do was to just be alone.	1
Some people go through all of the above, all at once. So maybe life IS as bad as all that for them.	1
But im not special. Other people who are more capable, moral, and intelligent and crestive are depressed and are deserving of your love and affection. They will probably make a recovery. What are you waiting for?Any good podcasts to recommend? What are some good podcasts to listen to during a depressive episode?A romantic relationship doesn't cure depression. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.	1
Does anyone have any thoughts as to how to get out of this cycle?My SO has panic disorder and it’s making me depressed. My SO has been diagnosed for now with panic disorder (waiting on health monitor results to check to see if it’s not something else)	1
Three weeks ago I was better than this. And I'm crashing all of a sudden. I don't know how I'm going to study for my finals and maintain my GPA to keep my scholarships. I'm fucked probably. My therapist is not that great and I haven't seen her in awhile and I don't have money to go back to her. My psych appointment isn't until late January, after my medical procedure.	1
aaaaahhhhhhhhh	1
Every morning I wake up I start the day ready to take it on. I tell myself I’m going to be productive and make strides to complete goals. But then I can’t bring myself to do anything. There are days where I can sit at my desk for hours just thinking about how I should be working on something. But then when I try, it’s like I can’t think straight. The things I used to be good at now don’t really seem to make sense to me. I feel like my brain is literally turning into mush.	1
I don't experience many of the symptoms of formal depression: I sleep pretty well most of the time, I eat okay, and I'm socially active. (I feel abjectly isolated, but empirically I spend a fair amount of time with friendly acquaintances at events and so on.)	1
Now no one cares. I‘m alone. I don‘t go outside anymore. I‘m just isolating myself again. No one really talks to me and I‘m just a bother to everyone.	1
When I got back home I was sent to an all boy high school. Once again I had to go to a new school and try to fit in somehow. I was lonely for a while until I met this girl. I'm afraid to write her name incase she ever reads this and it hurts reading/writing it but I need to get this off my chest. I met this beautiful girl named Cindy at a school function. She went to the all girl school down a couple streets. Both all gender schools would make events for each other to get students that social interaction. Anyways I meet this beautiful girl named Cindy, she was nice to me and I was nice to her. We dated for over a year and while it lasted it was nice. The way she broke up with me literally broke me. I was having a really sad day and told her about how I struggle with really bad depression and that I have suicidal thoughts. Her response was "oh" and she slowly stopped talking to me. Eventually she stopped talking to me and when she did talk to me she made excuses about not having time to talk to me. She was my only friend, the only person I was close to. She couldn't be there for me when I needed her most, when I needed a friend most. So I stayed alone thinking maybe school was too much for her at the moment. Then one day I get on Facebook only to see her on it, I clicked on her page and saw that she had been on hanging out with friends and having the time of her life. She slowly broke me, I couldn't handle it and called her to confront her about it. She made excuses and talked about how she didnt have time for me at the moment, so she hung up and left it alone. I was reaching my breaking point, I was going to commit suicide. I sent her a text message talking about how I needed her to talk to me and be a friend because I was getting worst. She never responded to me however she did get in contact with my school to let them know what I was dealing with.	1

My first therapist really understood me and listened. I could cry my heart out and afterwards I felt so much lighter.	1
This letter may be emotional.	1
I really miss that feeling.	1
When I got home that night, I looked her up on Facebook, and...she does have a much better life than mine. In every way. I feel angry that she seemed to have a great one while I've...struggled. The pharmacist always starts treating me like I’m fragile and could crack any minute as soon as she sees my prescription is for bupropion. I am fragile of course, but it kills me to see that visible switch from “general customer service friendly” to “you poor thing, let me treat you like the sad and fragile creature you are”.	1
I'm better than I was a year ago. I've joined a gym. I do pole dancing. I got a cat. I have a therapist. I'm medicated. I volunteer more. I see occasional good things in myself. I'm not actively suicidal anymore. Yet... I'm still depressed. I've changed my life so fucking much and I'm still fucking depressed. I still have more work to do to "fix myself" (fucking diet, fucking exercise, bullshit mindfulness) but it all just feels like so much goddamn work at the end of the day.	1
How is this allowed?  I sought emergency treatment for a substance abuse issue and am being unsafely yanked off a medicine I've been on my entire adult life.	1
Anyone else feel fake? I don't even want to talk anymore I won't ever say a word again, cause I would only regret it. Let me do what I have to do. I'll do what I have to do, I fear what I will do. I gave up. I did, there's no point in doing this. I'm sorry. Have a good day, wherever you are.How should I act when the people come to my apartment to remove the waterheater? how do I act? What if they talk to me?i’m so tired i don’t know what i’m doing in life or where i’m going and i know i’m young and have “plenty of time to figure it out” but that doesn’t make life any less intimidating. after i graduated hs my parents told me to wait to go to college because we couldn’t afford it. understandable, we’ve always been poor, just barely making ends meet. that was two years ago. i’ve watched all my friends go away to college, move out, become functioning adults and completely forget about me. and i’m living with my parents getting maybe $20 a month in allowance. sad, i know. but i’ve applied for jobs. everyday i look for a new place to send my pathetic résumé. been doing that for a while now. no calls back. my parents are overworked and stressed and they take it out on me. i don’t blame them, if they hadn’t had me they’d be doing pretty good in life. i just want to become something, really anything at this point, i just want them to be proud of me for once and i don’t fucking know how. i’m so fucking stuck and tired. it took me 18 years to grow into the useless worthless piece of garbage i am today and i couldn’t be more over it. just want to sleep forever. 18 years was way too long for me and i’m done now Has your family always ignored your problem? I think the hardest part of being depressed since I was a kid is how absolutely ignored I was/am by my family. My parents split up when I was 5 and my father died when I was 10. My family completely sweeped it under the rug like I was supposed to be completely ok with it and it has never been a topic of discussion at home. I walked around sad, slumbered over, quiet, avoided eye contact and stared into the distance for years and years and no one ever assumed proper to ask if there is something wrong with me. The only time they sent a psychologist my way was when they had to determine who I should live with after divorce. My mother to this day seems absolutely oblivious to my suffering.	1
Then I find out that she’s seeing other guys. My heart was gone, the only feeling is that feeling when your heart drops to your stomach. It’s a little harder to swallow, did life get harder? Did she make it easier? I don’t know. I wasn’t good enough for her. She says otherwise. I know she means the best for me with her heart but man, did it hurt the same.	1
I feel lost. I really don't even know where i stand anymore. Why would people keep telling me “you’re a good person”, I don’t feel like I’m a good person. Yesterday my best friend sent me a text telling me “you’re a good person, you’ll find someone.” All I could think was no I don’t want to find just someone, I wanna be with someone who resembles the guy I can’t forget. Not anybody will do and if I’m such a good person he would have stayed friends with me.	1
Life seems to drag on, I try to smile, I miss my best friend. I try to act like everything’s alright to her. She can’t be seeing me like this, it hurts her too.	1
You tell me I have to love myself before anyone else will. Those who grow in complete solitude don't even learn a human language. So tell me, if there is nobody to show me how to, how do you expect me to teach myself to love myself? I think you just want to place the blame on me. I don't 'love' myself and so that's why I am miserable. Not because of depression, not because of isolation, not because of poverty, not because of heartbreak, it's because I don't love myself in a world that's only taught me to hate and criticize myself. In this world where the people I thought I could perhaps give my heart to, say 'I care about you' and then show me those words are meaningless.	1

Stranger: but suicide is still more likely honestly	1
Orlando will take it as an act of aggression and with malicious intent. Grath will start complaining at Orlando for (admittedly) being immature about the whole thing. He'll start acting like we're ganging up on him, even though we're trying to tell him that when he asks for stuff in private the way he is, that we're only doing it just to shut him up. i've tried telling him to try organising things himself for a change so he's not always going "Hey! Wait for me!" but he doesn't seem to get it. Today, my mother tried to commit suicide. Due to recent family events, it awakened childhood feelings of abandonment, inadequacy, and loneliness in my mom. She felt alone. Luckily, she was too coward to utilize her personal firearm. She chose to drink herself into an oblivion and inhale exhaust fumes.	0
So here i am, a 19 year old boy (almost 20), wasted 1.5 years in uni, wasting parents money... I have no idea what i want to study next... The only study i consider doing is social work, luckily for me u can start in february. So i have to do some shitty job from november - february. I still have my highschool friends who i hang out with 2x per month? I have a loving brother and parents, good financial situation. I can earn some quick cash for 3 months and go back to study. But to be completely honest... I DONT SEE THE FUCKING POINT.	1
The best way I can put it is in the title - I simply don't want to *be*. And that's not because I'm overwhelmed by hardship or struggle, I've got it pretty good and there's nowhere I'd rather be. If, hypothetically, you took me back to before my birth and laid out an incredible life for me and said "alright, you're about to be born, ready to go?" I'd say "no thanks, I'm good".	1
My mom went to check in on him before going to the store. Since yesterday she’s been trying to get him to go to the hospital but of course he’s stubborn. When she came back from the store, she decided she’d have the ambulance come and pick him up because he REALLY needed to go in. Slurring his words, despite actually being sober in the mornings. When she went back to get his consent over phone to get picked up for the ambulance, he was out cold already. Lips purple, cold, lifeless. It had been only 30-40 minutes since she last saw him, alive, or whatever was left of his life.	1
How do I tell my friend that I don't want to hang out with Tony without coming across as a dick? Is there ever a point when I am candid about the reasons why? Does Suicide Ruin a Wedding? My younger sister is getting married this June. She’s a couple of years younger than me and more successful in every single way possible. How close can I take my own life without affecting the wedding? I can’t bear to go to it, but I don’t want to ruin it for her. Should I go ahead and go now, or can I afford to wait a month or two? Best friend has a bf and is MIA I want to start a thread for people who have best friends/friends who have been MIA as a possible result from having a bf/gf. Please share your stories and give advice to those who post.	0
I just want to be happy and have some motivation for fucks sake. Anyone have some good sad song suggestions? Sad songs have always helped me keep goingAntidepressants for GAD Are any of you taking antidepressants for GAD? What has worked for you? This will be my first time taking them once they are prescribed to me in a couple of weeks Holiday season I have pretty bad depression as it is but when the holidays come around it’s worse. I have a lot of trauma from the holidays as kid involving some shit with my family. I tried to tell my girlfriend but she gets mad at me for “being negative” and that it’s “immature”. How can I try and seem cheerful around this time of year when it’s literally the worst time of the year for me?This sub is useless I don't want to appear pessimistic or a negative person, but I do really believe this sub is useless.	1
I’m cold, and tired, wasting time and throwing away opportunities left and right because i have no idea what I’m doing, and I know that you’re doing well, that makes me happy. You deserve to succeed.	1
And now I want her more than ever. I was absolutely heartbroken when she cut things off with me, and I'm still not over her. And she knows this. If she cuts things off with Jake, I don't know what to do. I want her back more than anything, but at the same time it's like she put me through such pain and I don't want to chance that happening again. She is everything that I could possibly want in a girl, and I can't imagine myself without her. And we're still friends, which probably isn't helping to be honest. But she's still my best friend. Am I crazy for feeling this way? I’ve eaten meals by myself for so long Never really had people who stayed with me... Recess usually spent alone... Now, I find it hard, weird, awkward and very uncomfortable to eat with people. I just wanna isolate myself from the world.Forcing myself to the gym to better myself while also wanting myself to end Getting up and getting there is by far the hardest part, and having never experienced the part where 'it gets easier' I'm running out of excuses to bother going beyond the fact I've told people I'm going. Why girls do that? Why girls can make you feel like a shit and why do you need to cry so hard and much after them?Not allowed to feel bad? I feel like I'm not allowed to feel bad. I'm an unimportant piece of shit and there are so many other people that need help and all the other people are a lot more important than me. I'm not considered as a person, I'm just something to use to pull yourself up. It's like I'm stuck in a swamp and all the people step on me and push me deeper down just to get out themselves. I guess I don't deserve to feel good. Noone will care if I will kill myself. They'll just use another person. The life as an adult is soul crushingly lonely and isolating Seriously, it feels like it gets a lot more difficult to make friends. My best friend moved out of state and I realized I have nobody now. Everybody else I knew back in college/high school is working, has a SO or has kids to take care of.  I’m just tired of feeling so isolated and not a priority for anyone.Had to talk about myself in a group setting today We were all given the task of talking about our lives one at a time for two minutes	1
I'm gonna try again, and again, just because it ain't fair, these office-fuckers amuse their little egos by constantly putting me down, cause I let them, but I'm forgiving myself once fucking again. Once again, MOU ICHIDO BOYS, FOR THE GREAT JUSTICE, THE GATES OF HOMELESSNESS AWAIT, ONLY HOLY ONES SHALL ENTER, O-N-C-E  A-G-A-I-N, I forgive myself once again ONCE AGAIN Does this mean i need antidepressants? How are you supposed to feel when you take them &amp; they’re effective? i’ve been feeling depressed since i was 19, i’m 21 now. i learned to live with my depression. i took group therapy, then individual therapy but didn’t find comfort/couldn’t open up to my therapists. i don’t talk to anyone about my issues, so kinda now have a feeling of numbness. i kinda learned to live like this. i feel normal, i used to feel like there was a cloud over my head at all times.	1

16th birthday: My family and I go out to dinner to a restaurant that my dad chose solely because he had a coupon for it and buys the world's smallest birthday cake. Halfway through my birthday celebration the following weekend my friends abandon me due some drama bullshit that was apparently more important than me.	1
Trying to treat yourself? Wait until you see the consequences from buying too many things or eating too much or wasting time.	1
I was just dead. I made plans, wrote good bye letters, planned that my little siblings would get what money I had left. I know it’s selfish, I know it can get better. I even tried to find a program that sends emails at a certain time so everyone could get a good nights sleep before they received my letter.	1
I don't even have any friends to take to this fucking symphony. Not even one. I identify more with the characters in the books I read than with anyone I know. I don't know what to do. I feel so alone. I'm not even that close with my family, not really. Not well enough that I can even really talk about my opinions and especially not my emotions.	1
I wanted to live for my family but thinking I'm dealing with my mental illness alone is hurting me and its just too much....	1
I also feel bad because my SO is always trying to be an optimist. He's somehow perfected this even being depressed himself. Sometimes that bleeds through but he's usually hyper optimistic and it's exhausting. We've gotten in arguments in the past when he was less acquainted with my depression because if I wasn't immediately cheered up by him making jokes while I'm crying to make me laugh (let me work through my emotions, damn... It works sometimes but not ALL the time, seriously), he'd get insulted and take it personally that a single joke was not enough to change my outlook on life and fix all my issues. I feel kind of like I got a little snippy with him when I complained earlier and kept cutting him off and telling him how hopeless I felt and telling him, emotionlessly, "I just don't care to be optimistic. I don't give a fuck. What's that going to do? I'm already tired, it's just going to make me more tired" because I had a feeling that that was where he was going to go with it. I feel bad because he's just trying to help. But I am so fucking tired. So tired. I have a hard time doing anything if I don't think it has a point (Even if I hate a job, I'm still getting paid, and there is therefore a point to it) and I just didn't see  the point of doing all this. I think I do to make him happy and worry less about me. But I'm so upset that I don't have the capacity right now to do more things to emotionally keep him comfortable. That's stupid. I feel bad, but that's stupid.I could really use some reassurance that my life is worth living. I took a chance last year and despite depression I reached for a goal, which was me taking my first full-time job in the field I went to college for. This was supposed to be my big redeeming moment, the big change in my life. But it's been a few months at my job now, and things aren't going super well. I'm facing the very real possibility of total failure. If you can take the time, I could really use a message of encouragement, or if you'd like to share your own story of taking a risk and failing and still being okay in the end. I'm so upset and anxious right now. Thank you in advance everyone. Nothing is enjoyable anymore. Almost everything that I used to care for is simply starting to have no meaning. I feel dead and lifeless.	1
Edit: Also thank you for all the hug PMs they really do help ;-;	1

Stranger: because once you leave you cant just come back	1
Is anyone okay messaging me to talk? I can support you too if you want. I can't do school work and I have no will power left The past two years I've been having a mental battle with myself trying to do my work just to come out with bad grades and disappointment from myself and my parents. I don't if I'm depressed, an idiot, or just a lazy piece of shit but I'm tired of fighting and I just want to throw in the towel. I know my parents just want the best for me but they can't help me. Even when I'm in class it takes all my mental strength to do the simplest things like take notes. The most frustrating part is that nobody thinks I try to do anything. Everyone treats me like a complete dumbass because I can't do my work. I used to have an amazing memory when I was 5-6 years old but when I started elementary school and now it gets worse and worse every year. Sometimes I'll talk to someone and forget what we're talking about in the middle of the conversation for a second. I can't organize anything and I give up before I even try because I know in my head I won't be able to do it anyways. I couldn't pay attention in class if you payed me to do it. And I hate myself for it. I hate that I can't do simple tasks and I that I can't remember anything but I can't control it. It doesn't even feel like I'm in control of my life anymore. Is there anything I can do to help myself. I'm trying to change my diet and meditate as of recent. I want to be in control of myself again. I'm only in 8th grade and I feel like here's one last chance of hope before I trash my gpa and end up working at McDonald's. If you can think of anything that might help please reply. I might just do an lsd trip for insight to find a solution but I'm worried I'll just mess with my brain even more. Anything you Can think of will be great.I will end my life, sooner or later I’ve never felt more lost in my life. I have no idea what I’m doing with myself. I don’t even know how to explain how bad my mental health is .. I’ve made so many attempts to tell my parents how bad I’ve gotten, and all my mom tells me is that she’ll make an appointment for me to get diagnosed w/ depression, bipolar and anxiety so I can get the medication I need but she lies. She’s been telling me this for months .. I want to kill myself, because at least then everyone will show me the love I’ve always wanted. “When I die you’ll love me.” Light box Do any of you use one, and has it been helpful?  Sitting in front of mine right now hoping to get a boost!do therapists tell your parents about you diagnosis? apologies if this isn't a good place to ask. I'm a minor and I'm going to have therapy soon, and I'm very nervous. I likely have social anxiety and have no clue what to say. but besides that, my parents are probably the main reason for my depression, and Id much prefer if they didn't know. does the therapist have to tell them, legally? or by policy or something? will they not if I ask them not to? thank you.Truth: just because your sad for a portion of the day didn't make you depressedwhat the fuck what the fuck fuck everything fuck everyone, theyre all full of absolute bullshit and are fake ass fucks. fuck you and you and you im sick of this man, late nights not even wanting to be hhere for the past what, 2+ years? im too much of a pussy to end it and im scared as fuck of death but man what am i supposed to do im only 15 shit i dont even have a  real friend to talk to anymoreAm I going insane or is this normal? Zoning out I was always praised for my memory. Didn't ever revise for exams but I'd still get good grades. Nowadays not so much.	1
3 months after the breakup I started talking to a friend I met through my ex (however they were not and still aren’t friends anymore) and we’ve been happily together for almost a year now. There was a lot of useless drama with my ex about this which has been resolved but she still tries to harass me and my girlfriend. Last month she texted my phone from her friends number trying to harass me and it was just ridiculous.	1
I don't think I'm ever going to overcome depression. I've kind of learned to live with it, sure, but beating it probably won't happen; I'm way too cynical to beat it. It's just how I'm wired. There's a lot in life I probably won't get to experience because of how I am. And I still don't know how to change that, or at least make some good out of it.	1
Now that I'm back home, I'm back to being just as despondent as I was before. I'm cold and distant again. I don't want to talk to anybody. I'm back at work, in a horrible job with horrible people. I don't want to talk to my mom because she doesn't get it and it feels like she can't be bothered to try.	1
I just feel alone.Does anyone else feel insanely angry when they see injustice against others? Like I feel like I seethe with rage when I see others being mistreated Every time I watch the news about the political storm in America or anything I see in my twitter about police brutality or slavery in Libya, etc. I seethe with rage. I can't stand seeing so many people being tortured financially, mentally, physically. I hate it. I feel powerless and I feel angry. I feel like my depression grows with other people's pain. The more I see injustice, the more powerless and worthless I feel in the world.Have you ever been told you're cold but in reality you are the opposite? I've been told I am cold and emotionless but that's just what they see. I cry frecuently at home and feel that if someone would see me crying, I would feel completely voulnerable. Same happens with expressing how I feel. If anyone knew how I really feel, I would think they would use it against me or take advantage. Maybe they would think less of me, as someone weak and fragile.Describe your depression Here is how I would describe mine: I live an exceptionally fortunate life. I am a college student interning for a commercial real estate development company. I had two internships last summer, one in venture capitalism and one teaching middle schoolers how to code. I have a potential internship lined up for a Fortune 500 company in Miami next summer and potentially an private equity internship lined up. I have all the networks and connections in the world to be successful. But I feel so unhappy and miserable with my life. My thoughts are so irrational and negative that I can't see how fortunate I am to have all that I have. I make great money with my summer internship, more money then most adults make, but none of that matters, because I still have suicdial thoughts almost everyday. I feel hopeless all day, everyday. I feel unloved and unwanted. Even though I have more than enough to be grateful for, I still feel inferior and lower than the lowest of the low. Recovering from an abusive ex So I’ve stopped seeing a guy who was emotionally manipulative and abusive towards me. Honestly I feel so alone and hopeless. I feel like everything he said about me was awful was is true, and I’m just a needy, immature individual who alienates all those who offer help. I feel so damage beyond repair and like I’ve got no one to help me get through this difficult period. Do you ever secretly hope you get cancer? Do you ever go to sleep and console yourself with pretty thoughts as you close your eyes	1
Thanks for reading.Wishing I could cry, but can't It's really hard, trying to sit, and think about something, and having that feeling where you want to cry, but the tears just won't come out.	1
I can't make friends with people I don't know how to do anything right man.lonely Despite having great family that thinks the world of me, I just feel so damn alone all the time. I have great friends that reassure me that I'm not alone, but I struggle forcing myself to believe that. I hate this about myself because I'm grateful to have what I have, and I am god awful at showing my appreciation for this. A lot of the time I'm mentally just not here at all. Most days I can't stop feeling so shitty to the point where some days I'll take 5 hour naps throughout the day just to avoid any shallow conversation with other people. I've tried going into things with a positive mindset, but I still just felt distant.	1
It's like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. I see it in slow-motion, slowly falling to the cold pavement, but I don't know when it will finally make contact.	1
Why does depression always put you in a trap that you can’t get out of? There’s no solution except accept your problem and just be an introvert and ignore everyone.I just want a friend. Is anyone free to talk ? I'm just feeling super low.Reluctant to get diagnosed I'm reluctant to go to the doctor and find out if I have depression. I can't exactly explain this, but it's a combination of a few things. Part of me feels that I'm asking to be depressed and another part of me fears that I don't have depression and my problems are all just my own fault.I starve myself When I get depressed, I just can not eat. Everything sounds so gross and eating just seems difficult. I’m a very small person, 5’4 and 100 pounds. It’s something I’m self conscious about but weight gain has always been a struggle for me. I’ll go through periods where I’m doing well and eat 3x a day and manage to put on a few pounds, but then something happens and I slip back into my old ways and the weight falls right back off. Does anyone else do this? I try so hard to care for other people. Why does nobody care about me? I spent hours trying to cheer up my friend a couple days ago about her family issues. I messaged her today about my depression and she ignored me.	1
I don’t see why I have to live like this, I suffer from depression and constantly beatbox myself up over every mistake I make. I’m unhappy, I’ve been getting better since getting rid od him and focusing on the family that actually has time time for me.	0
I know i need to do things, i want to do them, but simply cant gather up motivation or focus to do them. I keep switching between other things, starting to watch videos , only to switch to another one, reading articles, browsing reddit until it's too late to do anything.  Then promising i'll do it tomorrow. Worst thing is that i don't really care if i fail. Anyone experienced something similar?	1
Financially in a dangerous situation.	1
But after i quit antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg ,the fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems and concentration issues has been persistent in my life. Now for 3 years.	1
You demonic piece of shit I'm done with you.You ever get scared that you’re not depressed? I’ve been going to a therapist for about a half a year now, and I just got diagnosed with Depression a couple of weeks ago. I’ve recently told my parents that I got diagnosed (I’m a teenager.) and they just said that I’m going through average teenage feelings.	1
Stranger: yeah but in a more natural setting	1
Ive tried reading, cross stitching, writing, adult coloring books, ANYTHING to make my life seem more interesting and pleasurable....and I just can’t stick to anything.	1
Just wanted to share my experience with others who might understand. People with depression can experience health issues and get dismissed so easily. It took me years and years to get anywhere. It’s a struggle to cope with both mental and physical illness. Here’s to getting through today, friends.	1
I asked her there and then if she wanted to keep it.  She said yes. We went to speak to my mum.  My mum asked her.  She said yes. She wanted to announce the pregnancy, to start all the planning, and looking forward to the future.	1
Most people know that depression has a way of demotivating sufferers. Things you once enjoyed no longer interest you. Nothing seems like it has a point.	1
Stranger: i dont	1
No one checks in anymore	1
I'm in my early twenties and just graduated with a bachelor degree in psych in October. I never really had a job during that time because I was lucky to have my school and expenses paid for and I wanted to focus on school. I've only had one job but it was 5 years ago just at a fast food place. My boyfriend of almost 4 years and I live together. He has a great job and pays for 2/3 of our expenses and I pay the rest. He's recently told me he doesn't see a future for us if I don't get my life together and find a job and start putting more into the relationship. I feel this is coming at a bad time because ever since I graduated I am really anxious and depressed. I find it hard to even get up in the morning, chores get neglected, I don't even want to get out of the safety of my bed. The world is bleak and I'm sad all the time. I can't sleep all night and then sleep till mid afternoon. I feel like my life is just staying home and having to do chores and feel sad. I try to apply to entry level jobs like cashier at the grocery store but no one calls back. I don't know what to do because I want to get better and don't want to lose my bf but I can't even get an interview to work at a high school level job. He has been really supportive and caring but I think he is getting to the end of his rope. I feel stuck and hopeless. Any suggestions? Therapy didn't work for me at all. As long as I can remember I have been depressed, and have been thinking about killing myself. Last year it got to the point where I decided I needed to try therapy. I went for a while, but there was no improvement. During this period I just got worse and worse until I stopped going. I wish it would have worked, but it didn't. I want to try it again, but since I am unemployed I can't afford it, and even if I could, I don't think I want to spend money on something that I doubt will help. I have no idea what to do. I keep getting worse...My birthday is in 15 days. I have never felt so unexcited &amp; Apathetic about my birthday in my entire life. Happy early birthday to me..Awaiting the downward spiral. Had an awesome weekend with a whole bunch of friends from online who all came together, from all around Australia, for three days of drinking and festivities. Now I've travelled home and I'm all alone again.	1
Yet we’re the stigmatisers? YOU’RE the one who solicitates a lawyer when you have tried a psychiatric drug that almost made you kill yourself now you want to fight psychiatry but you’re okay with kids being chemically lobotomised on Ritalin?	1
I may have butchered a lot of this vitamin D thing so please take the time to read this:	1
Then 2 days ago I went toilet and it happened again, severe pain, feeling very uneasy and then boom out of nowhere crippling depression, the waves just hit me.	1
I'm sorry that I made mountains out of molehills. I'm sorry at times I treated you badly, that at times I held you back.	1
I’m still in bed, haven’t eaten anything, haven’t done the dishes like I promised i would, haven’t cleaned my room. I’m worthless.Every Day is Exactly the Same. I'm Lonely, Worthless, and Done With Life Every day, I wake up, go to work, come home, and go to sleep. That's basically it. That's my life. Sure, I have a few friends that I see on the weekends, but it only helps so much.	1
But if I want to keep pursuing this path, I have to keep doing the parts that make me depressed (design and coding) for a significant amount of time so I’ve just kind of lost motivation to try at all. I know I should just push through, but I’ve pushed through my whole life and honestly, I’m tired of fucking pushing. Everyone is telling me to keep moving forward because I show talent in it (the design/code side of user experience) and it’s lucrative but fuck man I can only do this for so long. I’d rather use my creativity on music or writing. I have three internship interviews this week which isn’t good to have hanging over my head when I’m asking all of these questions.	1
I'm sick and tire of letting my depression get in the way all the time I'm sick of being shy secluded and uninterested I'm sick of letting my depression define me!	1
I was very careful not to unload everything on her, I basically told her exactly what I said at the start of this post: that I struggle with depression and anxiety, and that it's been getting a lot worse recently. Initially, it seemed like it was going well. She had several follow-up questions, some of which I wasn't entirely comfortable answering. However, for the first time in years I felt a genuine sense of hope, and felt like someone actually cared about me, so I answered them anyway. Eventually, she asked me what was causing all of this. I explained that while there are certainly things that contribute to my depression on a day-to-day basis, at the root of it, there isn't really a reason. It's just who I am, almost as if it's hardwired into my brain. It's hard to explain. Do any of you understand what I'm talking about?	1
All of those people can go fuck themselves.Ever Feel FB "Friends" Are Lying Out Their Asses? For real. How the fuck can people post about life being great, life is so good, and being blessed? It's like they want to rub your nose in it how wonderful their life is. While you're wallowing in alcohol/drugs, in a room by yourself, contemplating suicide.	1
I just have this endogenous, chemical depression that's as bad as being in physical pain. I've been on so many meds in the past and they don't seem to work for me anymore. I run distance every single day and eat well.	1
I don‘t even care about emotions, I doubt it‘d be that bad. No one likes me anyway. Just so they don‘t get into debt with my death or sth.	1
I feel like the most pathetic person on redditt, I keep reading about other people who feel like they messed up because of depression and I feel like in comparison they are all doing amazing! I just don't know what to do any more.	1
Can depression make you see only the 'negative' aspects of your SO? I don't know what to think anymore. I'm in a relationship and maybe we're just not meant to be.	1
I don't have an endgame. I don't have a goal. At best, the closest thing to a goal that came to mind was "Eh, I'd probably get back into riding, and buy myself a motorcycle or something". That was it. My mind literally blanks after that. Nothing else is there.	1
I couldn’t do it. I stood on the edge of a bridge, the edge of a cliff, wore my favorite clothes. Listened to my favorite songs. Every time I couldn’t do it. You never think of it as someone being brave. But I was scared, I couldn’t imagine how anyone took that step off, pulled the trigger, kicked the chair. They had to be brave.	1
If you read this thank you. Im sorry I made you read a lot and I'm sorry that I'm this way. I'll get better one day but not soon. I'm not worth it I just don't feel like I'm worth anyone's time or effort, and I just feel like a burden to everyone. I have a part time job (anywhere between 20-39 hours a week) and I'm at college (in the UK &amp; I'm 18)and I'm constantly tired. My mum is such a lovely person, but I really do feel like she'd be better off without me, she's always complaining how she never has time to do anything (she works 30 hours a week + she always cooks + cleans up after my stepdad and brother but complains about any mess I've made)  and I'm lazy, messy and I quite often ruin her day. But I'm sure I've ruined her whole life. She had me when she was 19, which meant she had to quit her job because she couldn't afford childcare and she had an abusive step-dad, who would refuse to let her mum look after me, and she also fell out with her very religious grandparents as she wasn't married (they have since made up). She then couldn't get a job until I started school (which is actually a decent job). At this new job, she met my step-dad (after a few years) and they've since had a child together (who also doesn't seem to like me one bit). My step dad seems to hate me more than my mum does, but I can't complain because neither of them are abusive, and this is one of my problems; I feel like I shouldn't moan about anything in my life; I live in a decent sized 3 bedroom house, I have an education and I also have a job. Whilst my mum lived with her abusive step-dad, was forced to quit college (so she could get a job to start paying rent) and was also forced to baby sit whilst her parents went out drinking every other night. Yet here I am, never feeling happy, without many friends (I talk to the people at work when I'm there and I have 2 other friends that I speak to around twice a month, normally because there other friends are busy and they want to complain about their boyfriends, or because the other friend doesn't want to go  shopping on her own ( another reason why I don't have a reason to be negative; she was in care and now classified as homeless as she's now 18 and not catered for in the care system, so now she has to live in temporary accommodation with lots of drug users in the same building.)	1
Just as a side note, at the same time as my depression diagnosis, I also got a blood test which delivered wonderful news that I had Lyme's Disease (which after much reading, I found exhibits many traits of depression and ADHD like disorders) and was promptly treated. Now I don't proclaim to be healed as I still exhibit a sense of lethargy, however, that might just be something I've become accustomed to and given getting out of my house, I am usually able to go out and be alive.	1
I started to feel unwell around December 2016 and developed a persistent, non-productive cough. Series of tests led me to an echocardiograph where it was discovered I was suffering Heart Failure. Dilated Cardio Myopathy caused by a viral infection, left my hearts function at 20%EF.	1
Stranger: id rather hit rock bottom then have no conciousness	1
i feel incredibly distant from everything. i feel like everyone is at the party, laughing and having a good time, and i'm stood outside watching. everyone just seems to be able to connect to one another. people seem to feel what i don't. i've gone through a tough part of life recently, and i feel nothing about it.	1
First of all, I want to start off by saying, all of my friends are not terrible. The majority of them, yes.	0
And I’ve always had big dreams for myself. But because of how I was raised, I have no accountability. Because seriously, why bother trying if everything I do is going to be met with disapproval and anger? So I’ve been trying really hard to make myself follow at least one goal. I chose to go for my art. Problem being that with my depression crashing on me in waves, I’m really struggling to stick to my goal of one art post a day. I’m trying really hard but I’m so afraid that I’ll be the failure I was taught to be.	1
Stop moving. Just end. I keep picturing myself walking out on my job. Getting kicked out of my apartment. Living in my car. That being repossessed. And eventually ending up in a gutter, wrapped in a a blanket but still freezing to death. Just frozen. Not moving, not willing and thus not physically able to bring myself to it. There is no point to it.	1
I dont know i just hate looking back at my day and realizing i wasted so much time doing nothing but wanking. Anyone has advice for this? Someone told me I look like I'm on power saving mode. And that's exactly how I feel.Have you ever cried for missing your childhood so bad? Well I often do, quite sometimes frankly. I just miss those good old days, when life was just so beautiful and easy. Nothing to worry about, nothing to cry for other than silly childish little things.	1
Dear people that think happiness is a choice, it's not. Me or my fellow sufferers don't choose to be miserable. In fact if it really was that simple, I'm sure 99% of us would choose to be happy without even having to think.	1
Few years later my home situation imploded. I ran. His mother took me under her wing, I think she was the first parental figure I could lean on in my life. His father loathed me as the girl from the slums, threatening me in private to never marry his son. Reminding me of my lowly descent when he could. He would never come to accept me fully but at least fully respects me in public, which to me is commendable enough.	1
I can’t let go of the relationships that didn’t work because I am unable to create new ones.	1
Then I was hanging out with a friend I hadn't seen in a while, and he admitted to me that he had been struggling with depression, so we both opened up about it. He ended up recommending the book "Feeling Good" to me, since it had helped him improve a lot. I read it and was initially a bit disappointed... some parts were underwhelming, some felt annoying/condescending, and the solution to every problem seemed to be the "three-column technique." But after trying a few of the exercises in the book, I admit it turned out to be somewhat helpful.	1
I'm proud I'm still here, I'm proud I've come so far, but right now I'm incredibly disheartened and I don't know how to process this sadness. Edit: everything seems suddenly so meaningless and fakeSo tired I lost my job in Feb. of this year. I have been on unemployment since and watching my son while i look for work. Well, thats about exhausted, then my water heater broke, then my only grandpa passed away suddenly. I thought i had something good going with a little media company with my long time friend, but that fell through. Now the engine in my care is locked up because of an oil leak i apparently didnt know about. If i dont find something soon it will all be up to my wife and she simply cant do it on her paycheck alone. It is all so tiring. Anytime i get a step ahead i cant help but get knocked back a dozen. I dont know what im doing anymore. I dont even know why im doing this right now. i fucking hate money.What ambitions are left to aspire to if you don’t want kids? I’m a 27 male surrounded by mombies and a culture that I don’t fit into. I feel like I’ve accomplished all my very serious ambitions from graduating college to studying in grad school and withdrawing, twice. (I was doing fine in grad school, they were job prep program. School Psych and a teacher prep program. I withdrew basically because I was apathetic about the job goals/mission. I studied philosophy/psychology during my undergrad and I feel extremely content with all the knowledge I’ve accumulated, but it just feels like I’m getting old. It feels like friends are moving away, the world is getting smaller, less wondrous. It’s like realizing I’m too old to aspire to great things like being an astronaut or something. I feel like my role models are way too big, or that things are just downhill from here. So I’m asking myself questions like why bother working? Why bother moving forward? Maybe I’m pessimistic and think the US political situation is horrible and it’s affecting me. But I wonder how older people without kids keep going forward. What pushes them? I firmly do not want my career to be my only reason to live. I do not want to live to work.I’m convinced money CAN buy happiness. Can it fix everything?  No.  It would fix my life.  Money would be freedom, safety, comfort.  Money would give me back control of my life.	1
I have my pride even through my depression for what I have survived and what I have accomplished. But I hate that I can not find it in myself again to open up towards my spouse and more than often find myself crying when I am capable to, so I can put up my smile and brave face when I NEED to. I’ve successfully faked it till I made it. And of the 15 years that we have been together the good by far outweighs the bad, something which can not be conveyed well enough in this post. But what has been said can be never taken back. Even though recently he said: Don't you understand after 15 years I am on your side?	1
God I hate this feeling, I'm really freaking out right now. I don't know if what I want to do is right, maybe it will make things worse, maybe I'm just a lazy horrible student.	1
A.M. Does anyone else miss the person they used to be? I've always struggled with depression, but sometimes it's more manageable than other times. I've noticed that with every new year and myself getting older, I begin to look back on my past and long for it, even sometimes breaking down because I miss the person I used to be.	1
I was raised around my family growing up. I didn’t see my father but I saw his side of the family, cousins, aunts and uncles. They may have lived states away but we always spent summers and holidays together.	0
I detest consumerism, generally speaking. Customers are not my favorite people. Along with restaurants, I hope to avoid customer interaction at my next job.	1
I believe that I will graduate in the next three years, and that I will be able to get As in my classes to increase my GPA. I believe I can graduate with honors, I believe that I will have enough money saved to actually visit Japan.	1
After recently getting out of the hospital for a(nother) attempt at my life, I was surrounded by family and friends who want to support me. For a couple days this almost gave me a high, thinking that maybe I really am glad I wasn't able to go through with it or that maybe I was beating these years of depressiveness. Not even just after a week of getting out of the mental ward, I fantasize about what I could have done differently to have made sure I died that night. Going forward I thought I would be happy being able to see my younger siblings and my dog again, yet the only thing I can think of is them knowing I tried killing myself, and that I have added just another thing to deal with and another burden on them. I will now be treated with *care* and people will be on guard around me, and I didn't want to do that to them. This semester has started again and I have already missed the first week, and while part of me just wants to drop everything, I can't afford to start paying back the loans. I just want to curl into a ball and not exist and have to deal with it all.	1
No matter how much rest i get i feel tired. Even if excercise, eat healthy, do yoga and meditation.	1
The world sees me as happy and outgoing even when I’m honest about my depression b/c I don’t SHOW it to anyone. I’m lonely. I’m tired. I’m not sure how much I have left to give. I try. I do. I wake up &amp; try to be positive, make the most of each day but I’m just going through the motions.	1
My dad is a lazy dirtbag who fights with me constantly for no reason other than he hates me. He hates how liberal I am, he hates the people I like, whatever I like he probably hates. He sits in front of a TV all day watching shit, he bitches about anything he can, yet does absolutely nothing to fix the issue that he's the main cause of. No clean dishes? I'm in the wrong even though he doesn't rinse his or even bring them to the sink. Pills went missing? He takes more than he's supposed to and forgets and goes into a rage. So on and so forth.	1
When i befriend with this person, i just feel a lot of inconveniences and jealousy in my life. Honestly, i often feel envy of his high scores, actually sometimes i even help him to do an assignment (like sending him a copy of my assignment) which annoyingly also makes him get a higher score than me.	0
I have a steady bed time each night, around 9:15.	0
I don't think I can handle the pain of losing my "friend" again.  I also have OCD and I obsess on things to ridiculous lengths and this is going to suck me into a dark hole for a long time.	1
I am from a well-off family but I’d tried to live by my own and lived in a very tiny studio. To my well-off friends, I might look humble. They partied, traveled, and dined together without me, and kept those in secret (some of those events were blurted by mutual friends). Especially one of them frequently ignored me. When I really needed someone in order to be discharged from a hospital, that person didn’t help me even though she could - she didn’t even hide it.	0
You: yes, it's nice to hear someone else who has thought about these things. and who can give an honest opinion	1
So here I am, 20 years old, no longer a teenager, but still a fucking child.	1
I'm so lost right now. The world looks like a very dark place where I have to suffer in agony just to get by. I'm so tired of fighting. I'm so tired of trying. I'm just. So. Tired. It has been a very long time since I've been this low. I feel like I'm doomed. Like this is all the happiness I'll ever be afforded. That even if I get the job of my dreams and all the money I could possibly want, I will always have a big, dark cloud hanging over my head.	1
but my brain is still fucked up and it always will be. i can live with that. but not when all these people around me are telling me how happy i am.	1
My last night at that school, my theory that I had borderline personality disorder was weighing on me. I had been thinking about it for a couple of weeks after I had finally figured out that my behavior and thoughts were not the typical college experience, thanks to my extremely honest roommate &amp; sorority sister. She told me that other girls in the sorority thought I was trying to "fuck with their guy friends" and slept with too many people. I tried to go to the student health center earlier that day. When I stated, "I think I have borderline personality disorder," they just said, "What do you want us to do?" The only action they were equipped to take was to call the on-duty counselor who had to drive 40 minutes to get to campus. When I told her about my self harm and drinking and promiscuity she replied, "How does that make you different than any other student?" This further cemented my past notion that I was just weak: the numbness and loneliness - the desire to feel anything at all - was normal, and I just had a huge character flaw by not having the strength to be 'normal.'	1
Person: "You realise each day you do that, your arm will get worse".	1
I wish I could gather up the courage to just do it and end it all but I am a coward and I am scared	1
TL;DR: I’m done, burnt out. Life’s never been good to me and I’ve stopped expecting “my turn”. I see no way to achieve the few things in life I want.It's extremely difficult for me to cry. I used to deal with depression through breaking down and crying at night, and it was a really helpful way to out all the negative emotion, and I always felt much better after. For over a year now, it's been extremely difficult for me to cry. Unless I'm pushed to the absolute edge, when I feel like I should be crying it's more just a feeling of emptiness. This means that I feel like I can never release my feelings, and that it feels really greyscale at times, and on the rare occasions I can cry it hardly helps as it's basically a panic attack at that point. I don't really know why I'm posting this, but does anyone else deal with this? I'd love to hear from someone who maybe has advice on how to handle it. Love all of you :)My girlfriend died and I don't know how to go on... She had cancer and was 27.. We've been together for 9 years and were going to marry in a couple of years.. We had lived for 2 years by now and everything was going perfectly.. maybe too much.. We were faithful, devoted to each other. She was my oxygen, I was hers. She was my first and truly love. I've never been with any other girl but her.. I feel kinda depressed and alone.. We had no many friends, so that just the two of us was enough for the most part of our lives.. I'll leave for our house next week, since I've been with my family so far.. I'm joining my old job again, but this time, no one will wait for me at home, my salary will be just for me, and all that mattered now it doesn't..  I've got no reasons to keep on living. Somebody tells me I should be glad to still be in this life. But as I see it, it's a curse, a damnation. She doesn't suffer anymore, as I am every second of my life now.. Just wanted to open up to you...Anyone else hate talking about depression specifically because all the attempts at help feel fake? Guess it’s stupid posting this, all things considered, but I’m a moron anyway and besides that I’m also looking just to see if I’m alone in thinking this. Like at this point I’d rather just hear comments from people who are also feeling down. “Help” from others makes me fucking angry at them, especially strangers, because it doesn’t do anything. It doesn’t make me feel better to be told “things will get better!”, it doesn’t help to be told I’m loved, and in the event people bring up stuff like “you’ll never get to have a family” (yes this does happen as though that matters) it makes me want to actually hurt them in real life. I don’t and can’t, but holy shit. I don’t even like when friends try to make me feel better anymore because it feels like they don’t even get the point.	1
Your sisterHow to avoid a relapse? I've been having a particularly rough year; I attempted suicide, the love of my life left me, I failed my year at university, I've been physically assaulted, I've been sexually assaulted and today my grandfather died.	1
So anyways, I can’t fulfill his wish. But getting communication back with him is all I want. There are no exceptions.	1
I’m looking for advice or anyone to be straightforward with me on any aspect of my situation. Thank you to anyone who reads this and responds! I thought things were getting better... Sorry for the little rant... I just needed to say this somewhere.	1
PLEASE don't suggest to get professional help. I know, it's the most rational thing, especially for the eating thing, but right now, I just can't, I really can't :(You are offered the chance to die instantly and without pain Would you do it?	1
The Marine Corps has done a lot to try and help suicidal Marines, but all our training videos depict some "clearly distressed" person telegraphing an intent to harm themselves. In reality none of these people let on the depth of their suffering and only one made an attempt to seek help.	1
A straight path to follow, a new future to envelop soon enough. The fact of the matter was that I had to pray to a god I didn’t believe in if I wanted to warp my happy spirit to glorious utopia. Logic overrides hearts quite rarely, leaving a snowflake and a shock of noise behind the mind that just wants it all to change. My bored mind only somewhat consciously bobbed his head around from side to side, keeping an eye on the reflective sign for a change of heart.	1
I'm not happy, or excited. I just don't care, really.	1
Meanwhile the financial manager stole $1000 and the boss didn't fire him.	1
When I meet him, he is cold and withdrawn and does not even acknowledge me. I reach for his hand and he lets me hold it, but the bus ride is filled with nothing but silence. He's looking out the window and he doesn't want to speak to me. We reach our destination and head to a restaurant for early dinner, but he orders one tiny dish and doesn't want to eat anymore because he has no appetite. I asked him what's wrong and he said he's just tired. I asked if he's angry at me and he says no. He continues being very physically affectionate by holding my hand and holding my waist but he doesn't want to make eye contact with me or kiss me. He smiles all of 2 times while we're out.	1
How many more deaths, school shootings, senseless violence, suicide by the administration of drugs? Will it have to be to wake you people up that psychiatry has killed more people throughout the entire history of the world than the Jewish halocaust?	1
Just feeling very isolated right now. It's one of those situations where all I want is for someone to realize I'm drowning. All I want is to be offered a hand up... To feel like I actually matter to someone. I recently lost what I would consider to be my last friend IRL and haven't been out of the house for any reason other than work in weeks. The person I call a best friend is a person I've known less than six months who lives half way across the country. I've been waiting around hours hoping he will ask me for a phone call. He hasn't. And I don't want to continually pester him since he hasn't offered me a phone call tonight. I don't really know why I'm posting in this group. I guess so maybe I can imagine that someone somewhere will read my current thoughts and maybe I won't feel quite so alone. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. i'm circling the drain i'm sorry if this is in the wrong place.	1
Now here’s where shit really hits the fan. So tensions build between my grandma and my mom because of my moms suspected prescription opiate and Benzo abuse. Anyhow, dfchs gets involved (not related to the drugs but that didn’t help) about 4 months before I go to college and my moms health deteriorates seemingly out of nowhere. So freshman and sophomore year I’m juggling trying to work to support myself, school, and helping my grandma take care of my brothers. I thought I could handle it, I couldn’t.	1
I Saw Someone Jump Today I was driving over the main bridge in my city this afternoon. This bridge has been used before. I was driving downtown and I noticed someone on the opposite side of the railing. My girlfriend was in the passenger seat and before I could say anything to her. They were gone. I didn't get to see their face and if I did I think it would've destroyed me. I crossed the bridge, pulled over and called the police. I wish I could've helped, yelled something, gotten out of my car. I don't know. I didn't even know her but I feel as though I've lost someone close.	1
So that's when I started to think that she might trying to get them to cut me off and thats why I used $29.00 of my SSI money to get the 2 mil as back up like I didn't think it was a big deal. It wasn't my fault to me because I wasn't the one sending letters trying to get someone cut off but my mom told me to not say anything about the letters when we had first found out and today is day to confront Cancer Rat. I had to do it. Now Cancer Rat wants to try and tell me what to do. She says "Girl, whatever I say to you is for the best. Whatever you did to make that 2 mil that I want you to stop doing it because it's not fair that you made your first 1 mil before your 21st birthday. You didn't do anything specially to get it. I mean like you SAT ON YOUR ASS!" She was pissed but I don't give a fuck.	0
Me. Do you ever feel like being hurt is necessary? i feel like i need to be in constant pain and be hurt in order to get my life together and actually try harder even though it hurts so fucking much.My cat just got hit by a car I can't even think about it too much. My family is a little sad but are kinda telling me to get over it. I've been in such a terrible depressive spell for the last few weeks and this just ruined everything. When older pets die by natural causes I don't cry as much as because I know we gave them the best life and they lived very long but my suki was only 2 years old she was so fat and adorable and I can't believe she is gone just because of a bad driver. She always came to me when I was upset she'd lay on top of me and snuggle. I wish I had more time with her. now I have almost nothing that makes me smile Humiliated and feeling like a disappointment When people see me out, I feel so humiliated. I have to make up some bullshit story  about “taking a gap year before I embark on a career” when really I wanna say “well karen I’m clinically depressed as fuck and worn down to the bone by my own thoughts so thought I should put my life on hold” but no one wants to hear that shit.	1
All in all I'm tired of pretending I'm happy, that I'm fine. BECAUSE IM NOT FUCKING FINE! I'm not happy, I'm slowly dying over here and I can't take this shit anymore. I desperately want to change. I desperately want to live a "normal" life, and I just keep sinking further and further down while everyone else passes me by.	1
We've hung out like 3 times a week for a couple years now.  I feel like we have a real connection but she doesn't show it if she feels the same.	1
P.S. I thought about solutions like slowly drifting apart from her, but I've come to the realization that I would rather have her in my life as a friend than not at all. But it still hurts. Even hate eating I can’t even eat anymore everything tastes like shit to me don’t like doing anything don’t want to go anywhere don’t trust anyone hate being alone but it’s the only way I know to stay away from all the BS.  What’s the point of living such a meaningless worthless life????	1

I am not the type of person to turn to the internet for self-help, but I'm at a loss about what to do and I feel like I have nowhere to turn. I'm 29 y/o F with a history of depression since age 14. I've been on and off about 3-4 different type of antidepressants and in and out of therapy since initial diagnosis, so neither concept is really foreign to me.	1
I think it's ironic. It's ironic that in such an overpopulated world, depression is such a big issue. We're the people that need intimacy the most, so you'd think we'd be in a position where intimacy is more readily available. But that's not how the world works. Our lives are still meaningless. We still hate ourselves. And we're still alone. I haven't felt anything in over a month. I have struggled with depression for a few years now, and I was doing really well. I met a girl online that seemed absolutely perfect, and she made me feel truly happy for the first time since I was little. In October, she just stopped replying to me. She sent a message a few weeks later faking to be a family member and lied about committing suicide. I just feel nothing anymore after that.I don't wanna die I just wish I was never born sometimes Why depression is, and isn't like a skinned knee: Some thoughts I had that I wanted to share I was just pondering depression, and I decided to jot down what I was thinking. It's sort of a good way to put words to what it feels like to suffer from depression.	1
The day she left my dad I ran after her car...I don't remember how young I was. I hated her for a long time...I still kinda do.	1
Myself and my mental illnesses have put me in a deep hole and I can't get out by myself, the thing is it's not just me I have many mental health professionals helping me but the thing is I've got used to keeping the mask on, white lies, they don't know the full extent of my problems.	1
I just need help. I don’t know what to do. I’m spending most of my time with my best friend and trying to be strong and give comfort where I can. I don’t know what the point of this post is. Any words of wisdom, advice, thoughts, stories would be very welcome. Thanks for reading.Feeling numb...? Has anyone else reached the point where they realise that they were emotionally numb in the past or still are now? Last year, my grandfather passed away and it was a sad time for the family. I was upset, but no where near what I think I should have been. I still have a hard time getting truly excited about things that should be fun, like going back to uni and seeing friends etc.	1
Today is your birthday and I want nothing more than to tell you I love you and hold you tight. To never let you go.	1
These 5 Marines, as far as i can tell suffer/suffered from depression. Pretty much every one of them was intelligent (like way too smart for the Marine Corps) and each of them stood out as "the funny one". To say very few people understood they were struggling would be an understatement.	1
But what has worked for me and helped me rarely have SA or A these days was focusing on my breath when a thought comes.	1
It's been three years. Despite some triumphs and successes, it still feels like I lost a war. An immense failure that didn't personify my persona, it personified myself.	1
Anyways, I just wanted to know other then counselling, if there's anything you feel that might be of use to me and my brain to move forward without Dad. Depression has creeped in the last few days with the grief to give it a double whammy. Also had a massive panic attack yesterday as well, which I expected but it never prepares you for it.	1
And to everyone in this subreddit I've finally found my bit of happiness, all thanks to you! I no longer feel alone, and you shouldn't either! Theres so many good people here on reddit. Hope you all are coping and hope you have a great day!Got 90% of my teeth pulled today i have such low self esteem from having bad teeth and today they got removed. do you think it will get better when i get parallels or will it look just as bad as decayed teeth?My one true wish I've had for about 6 yrs My one true wish I've had for about 6 years is for everybody I've ever known to forget about me so I can die without making anybody sad. But it still hasn't come true and I'm running out of willpower.Anytime you're alone, speak your thoughts out loud to yourself. It's a lot easier to avoid worse thoughts when they vocalized. I have OCD and this has been helping me tonight. Hope it helps👍I'm finally dead inside and I don't know how to feel about it Fear, Anger, Sadness... It's all gone. I just feel numbMy mother pt.2 I posted about my issues with my mother the other day, and I have discovered new information. She's been complaining to her boyfriend, and he has a busy mouth, so naturally he's spilled it all. I've learned that my mother never wanted me to move back in with her after I lost my apartment, and she's been saying she buys me lots of things: clothes, computers, etc. And I just toss them aside and never use them, because I'm an ungrateful child. So she just took the stuff and started wearing the clothes. None of that is true. What's probably going on here is that she's buying herself things, and using me as a scapegoat so she doesn't have to tell her boyfriend she has money, or bought things for herself. Or she's just delusional and making shit up. Maybe even that she's stealing clothes from me and covering that way. I could believe any of that. Either way, she wants me to leave, and I know she does. And that hurts like a mother. No pun intended. What I want to do is get custody of my younger brother, and leave the state. Just start over, and make sure my brother is raised in a safe and nurturing environment. Because I can't live with knowing that he's growing up in the same toxicity that I did, and how it'll fuck him up like it did me. She's two-facing everyone; talking shit to one person, then smiling to the person's face she just trashed. And if anyone tries to call her out, she gets pissed and plays dumb. Her sugar daddies have been showing up at the house. She does drugs on the daily. She's going to end up old, a lone, and with her kids and family hating her, no one coming to see her. I'm ready to disown her. It just hurts. Why is she like this? Why does it have to be this way? It hurts.Do you ever zone out and feel like you are a thousand miles away or dreaming when people are talking? Do you ever feel, (for example), watching people argue, having a conversation or a situation playing out in front of you or a person talking to you and you feel like you are a thousand miles away in a happy place or you are watching the scene play out on TV or in a dream?	1
Stranger: short term you need to be okay with being alone	1
I feel like I'm running on empty and doing the bare minimum to survive for myself while trying  to be a rock to others. My emotional resilience has been wiped out. I feel "okay" but I've felt like this in the past and it has turned out that I've just been lying to myself and making things worse.	1
Take a long walk down the lane	1
I suffered/suffer from depression. Basically from middle school to about a year ago when I finally started on medication.	1
Peacefully	1
Everyday is a constant struggle to stay alive and I hate that there’s still a month and half left until the date I chose. I should probably write my letters soon just Incase I don’t make it.	1
As an example, sometime last month I was having a pretty meh day, just... Not feeling the worst ever, but not feeling very good either, when on my way home I happened to find an iPhone sitting on a grate outside the subway station.	1
One of the exercises/quizzes in the book is the "Depression Checklist," which (as I'm sure many of you are aware of) assesses your level of depression on a scale from 1 to 100. At the time, I was scoring in the "Moderate" range. After a couple weeks of applying some of the exercises, I was down to the "Mild" range. So I decided to create a project that might help me learn a bit more about myself, with regard to the effect of my daily habits on my level of depression.	1
I've let my depression ruin so many friendships and relationships with loved ones I dont want to beat myself up anymore I dont want to use my depression and a means to try and emotionally connect with someone I'm tired of using it as an excuse for everything. I'm tired of loosing people because I refuse or just dont know how to be happy.	1
Stranger: i live with my twin brother	1
I feel like I don't deserve happiness, love, attention.	1
Anyone else have a reading habit or have found reading to be helpful in this way ?? And if so, what do you like to read ?	1
Again, I feel like there should be a lot of cautionary tales in this, but mostly I just wish I was the one that was dead.4 years Tuesday Tuesday will be the four year anniversary of when my dad committed suicide. My 21st birthday was this weekend and I got pretty drunk and started to think about it and I just cried and cried in the Uber with my friends. I’m really thankful for them. But there isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about him. The thing is, he was an asshole. To me and my mom. I didn’t know he was depressed, I just thought he was mean and didn’t love me. I really do think I could’ve prevented it if I’d known. I’ve been extremely depressed ever since it happened. I don’t think I’ll ever be normal again.No end in sight How does a person continue on when it's one shitshow after another. I'm supposed to be strong for my wife and kids, but at what cost. I'm slowly returning to self medication with drugs and alcohol. How do I help my daughter deal with her problems when I can't cope with my own. I'm supposed to be the rock, but Jesus Christ, I just want to disapear.I feel like I'm in a rut. I don't like it here. First post here, so here we go	1
I’ve never had anyone this close to me die. A friend who I had grown apart from committed suicide last year. I was upset,.. but I wasn’t this upset.	1
Even though by the end of my freshman year, I was cutting myself and promiscuous and drank with the purpose of blacking out so I could have even just an hour of relief from myself, I couldn't admit that I had depression. I thought I felt and acted like that because I was lazy, stupid, slutty, weak. Every semester, my grades slipped a little (or a lot) at a time, and my parents grew more and more disappointed in me. I had been a star student in elementary school, frequently getting the highest scores in class and got into every top middle &amp; high school. I felt like such a failure. At this point, my parents sent me to a very expensive therapist, which ultimately was a waste of money because all I did was bend the truth to hide every aspect of myself and life. I don't think I could have even been honest even if I wanted to at this point.	1
I’ve tried all that.	1
just because i’m better than i was a few years ago doesn’t mean i’m good. i’m better by comparison. but that’s it. and i hate being told how “great” i’m doing.	1
Should I let myself be gone?	1
I quickly left the house and went back into my car. I wanted to leave there because I knew I couldn’t handle socializing with other people. However, my mom followed me back into my car and started to ask why I was leaving. I tell her that she lied to me and I can’t take deal with my social anxiety. She says she doesn’t believe my social anxiety is real (mind you, I’ve spent two month in a psychiatric hospital last year) and says she wants me to stay. I tell her fuck off and get out of my car but she doesn’t leave.	1
This girl I started to hang out with and we both seem into each other but she has reservations about anything serious bc we work together just informed me that she is pretty much busy until I leave the country....which does coincide with one of her best friends moving as well...awful timing I know.	1
I think I'm about to lose my mind.i Thanks to anyone who read this.	1
Own titles like “I beat depression” I “beat bipolar” not resigning yourself to a pathetic existence of numbing your emotions and dying 20 years younger on psychiatric drugs.Afraid to post my own comments/opinions on social media. I'm just realizing that all of the social medias I have or use (IG/ Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit and so on) I only repost/like other users posts and rarely post my own.. Idk seems like I'm afraid of what others think of me and that I'm insecure about something Even Good Days are Meh I didn't have a bad day today. I didn't have massive anxiety, my depression wasn't too prominent. Despite all this and despite having a good day I still feel kind of meh and disconnected.I just want someone to hug me and tell me it's going to be okay. Even if it's not. Depression and grief I am a 28 yr old M, who has been diagnosed with treatment resistant MDD from the age of 16.	1
My feelings just don't want to feel anymore.Lonliness is suffocating No friends, no social life and being socially awkward sucks. Help: ruining my University course Second year student here in a UK university. I hardly tried at all in the first year, got generally bad grades on my coursework, but revised just enough for the exams to get a 2:1, which is second from the best grade. I also had a few weeks of socialising separated by many weeks of pretty much self-imposed (and lack of sleep imposed) loneliness. So at the time I felt terrible, but looking back on it from second year I had some good memories.	1
Stranger: even if things are shitty	1
I'm crying on my couch. And I don't want to talk to anyone I know personally because they will try to tell me I have reasons to be happy, or my fiance will tell me that .... I don't know. I just need to not have an easy out sitting in my closet.Sick of rejection Met someone on an app we seemed to click and talked all night till like 4am, same the next night and the night after that etc. Honestly for the first time in ages I thought Id done it and found someone who liked me aswell and we could hang out and have some fun, even just over the summer Id have been happy with that.	1
I don’t know what the next step in my life is? Who am I? Is there something more to me than just working then going home just to sleep all day? I’ve had a small problem with taking pain killers like oxy, vicodin, and codeine. I just don’t find any joy in any part of my life. I don’t want to die, but at the same time I wouldn’t mind not waking up tomorrow. I just want a passion. Something to live for. I don’t want to be like this, but I’ve tried different things all my life and I’ve lost all joy.	1
In love, I'm full of goals, ideas, glass half full, my bank account may be low, but it doesn't effect me. I can deal with anything while in love. I'm more confident while in love. I loved to buy her little gifts, make desserts for her, clean the room so she can relax after a long day, shower with her and wash her body, and of course fuck.	1
I've fallen into a depression of guilt to a magnitude that I haven't experienced since I was a self-loathing near-friendless 7th grader with pent up emotions drowning it all out with video games while tanking his grades, watching the few distant friends get reward after reward, trophy after trophy.	1
I have no friends. I used to be a part of rather large group of friends, but as of now I couldn't tell you the last time I talked to any of those people. They've either moved on and some of them are no longer on this earth. I have acquaintances with people at work, but they have their own life to live and when it's time to clock out, again I am left to go home alone and broken. The only person I "have" is my mother, and she tends to make matters worse when I try to open.	1
I apoligize if this doesn't make sense but I just needed to let it out a bit.	1
I don't know if this is just a rough patch in my life, or a sign that I have a more serious problem. But right now, I have very few people that I can be 100% open with, and it's been tough. Work is, for lack of a better word, quiet for me, meaning I spend most of my time thinking, and it doesn't help much. Since I've never really had a stretch like this before where I've been as mentally drained and just sad, I'm not really sure what to do. But there's very little on the horizon that I'm looking forward to, and I'm worried about that.	1
Stranger: just having whatever social circle youre comfortable with is enough usually	1
You: now do u still live?	1
This world makes me fucking sick and I get sicker every day. I always wanted to go to the therapy but my very huge and overprotective gossip-loving family made this impossible for me to do Not only that but even a little hypothetical talk about it would instantly gain unnecessary panic like attention and after several phone calls to friends, family members with something like *"Hey Clara, he wants to go to the therapist. Is this normal? Which one should we call? Do you know anyone? Ask John please!"* And next day there will be several people touching my hand and saying "Hey are you fine?" Making it feel like something is wrong with me when I just want to talk to a professional in person without feeling like a babe.	1
I often find myself also thinking that I will never leave a goodbye letter or tell them goodbye. Because no one cares anyway. I told them many times before why I want to die.	1
I just don't get why the universe picked me to be its miserable little experiment. I never asked for anything bad to happen, I never asked to constantly feel tired and under the weather, I know that life isn't gonna be perfect but why is it that day after dull ass day I have to feel worse and worse? I try to take responsibility for my health, I feel like dirt, I have other people have some part in it and they take it for granted and hardly any of them actually make a big effort on me.	1
I try so, so, so hard to not be depressed. But if I’m not pushing myself 120% to stop it, it comes back, and I’m back to square one. And I can’t, I just can’t keep doing it. It’s just like pushing a rock up a mountain with no peak.	1
*breathes*	1
She invited me to hang with her friends. I invited her to hang with mine. We would do things together, play music together, video games together, and just genuinely hang out. We talked things over and settled our fight by blaming that terrible person that we both dislike from before.	1
What can I do?	1
My third stay I end up living in a small apartment with a woman who was good at hiding her side prostitution gig and methamphetamine addiction.	1
And if I did, gave up, did the unthinkable, no one would know for months. I Just Found Out I'm a Toxic Person I manipulate people I ruin all my relationships I don't want to get help or change I have problems I shove said problems onto other people I cause other people to be angry I am extremely critical of everything and everyone I blame others for my problems I hate myself	1
The list of things that make me happy and want to live grows shorter every day, and I'm so, so lost on what to do anymore. I feel so uncomfortable and just... wrong. Like I know something bad is bound to happen.	1
And me, I was also becoming like my dad, but ever since Mid 2017 I’ve had a fear of me or my brother becoming like him in the future. I’m using my words, I’m trying not to yell. I’m trying not to walk off after every arguement so I can tame my temper. I’ve slipped a few times, but this fear is actually changing me for the better. I’m telling my brother not to answer back to our parents but he won’t listen. I’m trying to help my mum because I feel sorry for her. So recently, it’s me and my mum trying to stop my brother from yelling at us, stopping our dad threating/slapping us. I’m trying to get my brother to see the future like me.	0
I don’t necessarily want to die, I just don’t want to live, if that makes sense. I feel as if my husband, friends, and doctor are keeping me artificially alive with all these treatments that don’t work, when in reality, I’m that painfully sick dog that needs to just be put down already.	1
I really do not know what to think...	1
I’m absolutely devastated that my children won’t be able to grow up with them around.	1
Then, I imagine you have a shot of getting invited somewhere. I'm not a fucking magician, I can't keep you entertained consistently for that long.	1
I feel like I'm going to have to either let her continue to talk to me like this or stand up for myself and lose her as a friend. While the latter option gives me the peace of mind to think it's not me, that I had enough self worth to stand up for myself and not cave to my friends abusive reinforcement, I really don't want to lose her as a friend. I just don't know what to do, she usually doesn't listen to me anyways. I don't know, maybe I am just a dirtbag.	1
I can show emotions, but feel nothing inside.	1
We finally arrived to the present time, thank you for the people that made it here.	1
She’s mad at me and I feel like I am trying my best but my best is not good enough. Also, says I have become obese because of my laziness...... that one really hurt..... I try to walk/jog a good 30-40 minutes 2-3 times a week if I have time.	1
I know I should face my problems but I don't want to and that amplifies my anxiety.	1
To many times someone In the sevic industry just says hello and I feel the need to tell them my lifestory to make me feel better. Sorry about that....Kill myself because I don't have a girlfriend I've been a shut in for about 2 and a half years now. Everyday I stray further from God's light. I'm really embarrassed to show my face to anyone who's not my family, I really want to buy a mask for when I go outside, that way no one can look at my shame.	1
And how about you? Have you ever cried for missing your childhood so bad?I’m ready to be okay with being alone... I want to be okay with being alone. Physically and mentally. Some days I can go home from work and be okay... but most days I can’t. I just get really sad. And I don’t even know why. I cry.. for no reason. I’m just super upset. And just constantly wonder how great it would be to never feel this again. I often wish I could just be gone and not exist anymore. But I don’t want to kill myself... idk how to explain it. :( I want to be able to be okay without having friends. I have two friends. And lately I feel like they are just both rude to me and just don’t care anymore... (they aren’t friends with each other so they aren’t like ganging up on me.) I just feel like I’m less important to them. And they are both just so important to me. And I wish more than Anything I could be on my own and not need them. I’m really not sure what I’m tryin to say. Other then... I’m just not sure if I want to continue this life anymore. But I can’t kill myself. I lost my mom about a year ago. Well she’s alive... just not the same. She was in a motorcycle wreck, and she’s a totally new person. I can’t even stand to be around her. We were best friends. And now I don’t even have her. I know this sounds pitiful but I just don’t know what to do anymore.. 😞Laid off today Had a good year for the most part, but walked into work today and after about an hour I got laid off after 3 years. Man... the shame and self disappointment was pretty hefty telling my girlfriend. It makes me feel less viable as a man, not even sure of the future anymore. I want to share a personal project I'm proud of A month ago I was feeling completely unmotivated to do anything. I was feeling that none of my connections with friends are as deep as they used to be, that I'm not as close to my family as I used to be, that nothing I do at work really matters, and that my health is slowly deteriorating. I just wanted to quit at everything.	1
I honestly don't comprehend why I won't just end it all...That orange message-notification... It makes me happy, wanted, feeling like I belong. I love comments because I feel so alone in all of this. Even if the comment didn't help a lot, I feel like I'm not alone. Oh god I'm so miserable.	1
If anyone wants to chat at all I'd enjoy that. I’ve lost the last of my hope for “my turn”. I (24M) think that without making the conscious decision to, I’ve given up. I think I’ve just reached the point where I’ve stopped kidding myself that it’ll all “get better” or “work out someday” like people always tell you. What I can’t seem to shake is the faint screaming in the back of my head trying to get me to fix everything, the one who still believes happiness is possible despite my entire existence thus far indicating otherwise.	1
To give a quick summary here is what happened to me: I grew up incredibly wealthy. My Father was an ex alcoholic. My Mother died when I was 13 and my Father went back to drinking to cope with the loss of his wife (my Mother). My Father became suicidal and threw everything we had away. We went bankrupt and I went to live with my Brother across the country.	1
Now Trump has ended it. The final decision will be made in early August, but it's most likely going to be rescinded. What am I supposed to do then? Just fucking accept losing everything? Everything I worked towards will have been for nothing. Even if daca continues, am I supposed to just keep living in fear of it ending again forever? I'm losing all my fucking hair stressing over this. I've had a cold for months that hasn't gone away, and everything hurts.	1
I'm becoming increasingly confident my genetics and values combine to make forming meaningful connections with other humans effectively impossible. Because I yearn for such connections intensely, it's only rational that this dynamic would make my life unlivable.	1
In my mind all of this is some kind of a cosmic joke because I don’t think I would find someone like him who’d be interested in me. This leads to nowhere, I feel so sick and tired of it all already their expectations and my lack of motivation to improve myself and poor sense of self-worth. I did it bois This time forreal lmfao.	1
The worst thing about this is that my day was going well. I don't have any issues.	1
I'm so sick of reading replies to mine and other people's post about depression that try to oversimplify a serious mental illness that can cause suicide.	1
Why? Why am I not good enough? Why do people say they care when they don't? People only like me for what I can give them. When I can give them support and be a good friend they like me. But I'm not good enough to warrant anything in return I guess. I help my friends when they're sad. Why does nobody want to help me?It's hard to keep standing up, keep fighting, and get down each time. I just want it to end I’m done. Hard work doesn’t pay off. Ever since I was 14 I felt depressed and like I’m not good enough. I felt like it was my own fault that I felt so sad and angry and that I wasn’t good enough for other people. One day I decided that if it we’re my own fault I felt that way then I could also improve my situation. Al my negative emotions went into working hard.	1
I hate myself.	1

I'll never be effortlessly beautiful. I lost the genetic lottery. I'm reminded of this whenever I see photos or gifs of young female models. My DNA is wrong. I don't know what I did to deserve this. I don't even have enough money to get cosmetic surgery.	1
I've been really trying to put myself out there too which is why it's so crushing every time I see a friend of mine go on a date with someone they just met, but every time I try to ask a girl on a date she just stops responding to me....I feel like there is something deeply wrong with me and I don't know what it is!!! I really just want to die, I'm so sick of getting rejected and feeling like I'm never going to be loved.I lost my best friend. My best friend used to always be there for me, he was the barnyard kind of personality, with tonnes of love and compassion for everyone around him, and along him was excitement and exploration. We used to explore the woods together and sometimes sit and stare at the campfire for hours until we fell asleep together. His name was Archer, he was my cat, and he was my best friend. A woodland animal killed him, he was defenseless..	1
I've lost all my Bitcoin in a fire. I was one of the early pioneers and had literally a couple hundred thousand dollars worth not too long ago. I'll admit this one was getting to me quite a bit. Especially since I could've prevented it.	1

She gets aggressive if I don’t offer a solution but when I cave and suggest another way of looking at things she throws it back in my face. She will often cite conversations with others where she’s gotten into an argument, and for hours will push me to give an opinion as to what she did wrong and when I diplomatically suggest doing something different or how maybe the other person didn’t mean it how it came across she will say I don’t defend her and make passive aggressive remarks. She’ll ask me to make decisions and then complains of it doesn’t give her the result she wanted!	0
I'm torn. Should I just get a cat for the sake of my health, or should I endure the wait a little longer so things can settle down a bit more?I have my ECT consultation today and I’ve never felt more alone. I have a good support system around me but somehow I’ve never felt more alone than at this moment. Nobody else that I know has had depression as severe as mine, or has ever been in this position where the choices are: be miserable forever, or zap your brain which might seemingly cause permanent memory damage and may not even work after all that.	1
I just hate the life I have. I feel like I'm in a terrible mindset. It's a mindset that doesn't let me grow, but makes me think I should try as hard as I can to.	1
In April 2017, I first had feelings of depression, when I realised how badly I had hurt someone who used to be very important in my life. (it is an extremely long story and I am slightly more at peace with it now so I don't feel the need to explain because it would take forever). I was incapicitated for a week, I would cry constantly, not leave my bed, and my mum would scream at me and tell me she 'didn't have time to deal with my shit'. However I had a REASON for feeling this down, so whether this was the start of a biological depression, I am not quite sure.	1
I was really really really lonely last year, i just spent all my time playing runescape, talking with my online friends. November 2016 i met someone and we became super super super super close. (he is american, not lovers just friends). We still talk to each other everyday. Man we even were planning to go to japan together but my mom wont let me. But coming back to that later. During the weekends i had my old friend group from highschool, we still hang out 2x per month, we still do. But they mostly spent time studying and hanging out with their uni friends. They didnt left me out or anything but i had lost alot of contact with them. I failed 50% of my courses, i decided to call it quits. I was happy that i could finally leave that student room. uni year 1 was HORRIBLE.	1
There are good days at work. But there are also bad days. And those bad days make the lasting impression, in my experience.	1
Now that it's over, I feel worse off. I forgot what it feels like to not be crushed by depression and all the shitty things that come with it. The depression has seeped right back in and it hurts more now. I should be grateful I was able to escape it for a moment, but fuck no.	1
I dissapoint everyone because I was the one destined to be smart and be the first (family name) with a degree and stable job.	1
At a certain point I stepped up and decided, 'Okay, if they truly believe this about themselves, that people always leave them, I'm going to be the person who doesn't.' For the record, I know of a mutual friend who did push this person randomly out of their life—so as far as I know, it's not a lie.	0

I just found out that I may be infertile. After my doctor said having a baby could help my condition. So that was depressing too. (I don’t think my depression caused my infertility. Checkmate, doctors!)	1
I just want it all to end. Please let it end. Emotionally offline I shouldn’t be writing this, I have three final projects due in the next couple of days and I haven’t started on any of them. But I don’t have the energy to even get started...I don’t know what to do. It’s too late to ask for extensions but I don’t want to fail my classes (that mean nothing to me). Whatever...I guess I’ll turn out fine because I was doing well grade-wise up to this point, but it’s gonna be fucking painful.	1

I feel relieved that I only have 2 more weeks.  I don't have another job lined up yet but I had to get out.  I know that's not a good choice, but the anxiety is so intense there.	1
I leave but now I have so much anxiety that I can’t drive. I park my car in a nearby parking lot deciding what I want to do. I have so much anxiety at this point that I made a post of /r/suicidewatch but quickly deleted it.	1
This started happening to me once ever 6 months, then once every 3, then every month and now once a week. It lasts 20-25 seconds maximum but afterwards I feel calm and relaxed and as if I am not there anymore. Am I alive? It's hard to explainRan out of medicine I have less than a dollar to my name until Monday, and my Bupofrin ran out. It's only a day, but fucking keep me in your prayers.Fundamentally Disinterested in Life Itself Even if I weren't depressed, life doesn't even seem all that appealing.	1
The only person in this world I feel I can talk to about my problems are my husband and I know that's a huge burden on him to be my only outlet, my only friend. It's putting a strain on our relationship and I blame myself for this. It's a lot of pressure to put on someone. Living with a person with depression is hard enough under normal circumstances (whatever normal is) but add the burden of being the only friend, the only person that knows, the only person period. Eventually that only person is going to get tired of it.It's been almost 7 years.. 7 years.. Holy shit.. It'll be 7 years in May.. It still feels like yesterday when I got that call from your dad, telling me what happened. And I remember dropping everything I was doing at work, and rushing to the hospital. Slowly walking into the room, with your family gathered around you, that's when it hit me, and I broke down.. I lost it.. Couldn't control myself, and I couldn't stop crying. When I had to say goodbye, it broke my fucking heart.. Losing my best friend, my fiancé, was the hardest day of my life. But every year after, the pain slowly faded away, and it didn't haunt me anymore. But last week, when your dad called me and said that he'd be in town for work, and wanted to get together, it made my day. Hadn't seen/heard from him in about 6 months. But last night, when your sister called, and told me that your dad passed away in his sleep from a heart attack, it was like the whole world had stopped spinning again.. Fuck, it's been a long weekend. And damnit, it's gonna be a long week..	1
But hey, crisis momentarily averted lolMy nightmare is living like this for the rest of my life I just can’t take being lonely and constantly failing at everything I try. Fuck my father!! I don't hate him anymore for giving me a rough childhood,I don't love him either,instead I pity him.He has gone through a lot of hardships:losing a brother,going through a nasty divorce,having a sister with a chronic illness,finding out his first born (me) is a necrophiliac,then going broke...	1
Another example. When I was in high school, someone I knew had an older brother than went out drinking one night and when he came home, he died, choking on his own vomit.	1

UPDATE- I’m currently sitting on the side of the highway because my car broke down on the way to the interview. Why do I even try?! Just graduated university. Anxious and depressed, can't find a job, scared of losing partner over it Hi everyone. This is my first post on Reddit. I just felt like I needed advice from people who might understand.	1
The worst part is I don't know of I can ever have the same relationship I had with him before. We were buddies. Even if I get over this I just don't know if the trust will ever be back. This makes me sad. I didn't really want him involved, but good intentions make it hard to tell people their help isn't wanted. Dear reddit, happiness isn't a choice for everyone I'm sorry but I need to get this off my chest in a place where people will understand me.	1
Let me explain who we are :)	1
So where I am at today is the episode I've been in is decreasing in severity.  I've been having some success with (through?) adding some structure to my day-to-day.  Using checklists and schedules and other work tools seem to be helping with the mental health work I have to do.  What are some daily/weekly/monthly 'tasks' you find help your health?What are ways to connect to a close person who is depressed ? I’ve been dating a girl for 7 months and I’ve notice her cycle of moving close to me then pushing me away . She gets secluded, and almost checked her self into a hospital last month but she has never really opened up about the complex feelings so I’m wondering how can help relate ? How can get her to know I’m here to listen and attempt to understand . I tell her often how special she is to me, I get her flowers at her doorstep, I show the love but recently, I’m trying to connect a different way.	1
What about going to therapy,  is it worth it to keep going? I mean yeah,  i have someone to vent to and they listin to me. They don't tell me things like, "you have no reason to feel this way" or things like that.	1
Waste time as I scroll through my social feeds	1
All of it feels unreal and at the same time scarily real.	1
When I was self harming and tried to commit suicide she took me to a therapist to try and get my in a inpatient place...she didn't want to deal with me. I should be an actor... I feel like most people who have depression could work in theatre or movies. I don't know how you guys feel about putting on an act when really you feel so sad that it's hard to breathe, but recently I have been having to act like I am getting better from depression. My roommate confided in me one day when I came back to our dorms that he struggles with depression. He was placed in a foster home after his parents died, and his foster mom committed suicide. After that, his friend also committed suicide, so of course this takes a toll on someones' emotional health. I told him that I started taking meds and going to therapy, and I smile and laugh and act like I am doing better so that he can feel encouraged to get help with his depression. I feel so fake though, even though I am getting help, I don't think it is helping me, my chest has that particular empty feeling and breathing is hard to do. I feel like crying a lot of the times now while I am laying down in bed, and driving to and from class. I would never let my roommate know that I was actually not doing better though. I really want him to get help because I see myself in him, and he is a really good person who doesn't deserve to be sad. I wish depression never existed, it is such a sick disease.Sometimes I feel that if I could cry It would make it all better. I would just feel better, and do better. My emotions are flat, and have been for as long as I can remember. They've been sliding down more than up for the last 8 or 9 months. I just want to cry sometimes.When boredom turns depressing. Maybe you have nothing to do and you are left to be alone with your thoughts. Maybe you are procrastinating on something and your letting the guilt eat away at you. Maybe life couldn’t be any better, but you still feel like all your pain and suffering that led up to this point in time wasn’t worth it, and it still isn’t a bad idea to commit sepuku. How do you guys cope?Lost my dad and my pet within the last two weeks. We took my dad to the hospital and found out he had a tumor in his colon. They removed it and several surgeries later he was in recovery, eating, and ready to come home. My mom spent day and night by his side for over a month at the hospital and refused to leave his side.	1
I used to be very passionate with certain things but that was usually meant with me being bashed and shunned upon people. Or simply just a turn off.	1
My life is a MISERABLE cycle of depression that I cant seem to get out of. I NEED help but I literally dont know how I can get myself to suck up the pride and go to a psychologist.I hate myself I have nothing but contempt for myself.	1
Later today I got laid off because I didn't text him that I was sick the day after. Which I thought we established that I can't come back to work until I felt better.	1
I've thought about it a lot throughout my life. I don't think I'd ever have the stones to do it. Maybe my life or state of mind just isn't that bad. Not yet anyways.	1
The day before the Super Bowl, I felt an episode coming on. It wasn't severe, but it made me fragile. I'm a big Patriots fan, so when the Pats lost, it set me up for a bad episode. If I'd just been sad about the Patriots Monday and let myself heal like I usually do when my teams lose, everything would have been fine, but instead I started to blow my friendship.	1
I don’t feel any joy anymore, should I see a GP? Do therapy sessions work? I don’t see what they could tell me that I already know, exercise, go out and do things - talk about how I’m feeling. I’m pretty self aware.	1
P.S.  Mr Rhodes, give Elaina a hug for me, and tell her I miss her, and that I'm doing alright. I'll see you both again one day.I wish I killed myself like I promised I was going to on the 6th It would've been much easier than dealing with my stupid fucking life.I wish I could disappear and leave it all behind. I've been constantly thinking of jumping in my car and just drive away from all my problems since new years. Is it a crazy idea? I don't think anyone would miss me.Wish I could fucking cry tbh I have never felt less like a human being There truly is no hope. For any of us. This is the bleakest truth of all. Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you may never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born.	1
Nobody wants to listen. Everyone assumes that the funny guy is just fine. Nobody wants to have a genuine conversation because sometimes I’m a real fucking downer.	1
I've typed this out way too many times so I'm gonna do my best to sum it up as short as I can:	1
I want to first off say this is a throwaway. I also looked for similar post regarding what I will ask, but i really want a tailored answer for my own sanity. Sorry for being selfish, this is just hard. I have been dating this girl for almost a year and I know she has been slipping into an abyss of what I cannot diagnose, but seems like depression. I will start with a time table.	1
**TL;DR: I ended our friendship of two years because I was going through an identity crisis and she was dealing with severe depression and it made me feel terribly drained. I regret it though and I've been missing her so much but I don't know how to contact her again as she's got a new close friend and seems to have moved on. I've been thinking about making an audio for her where I talk about our friendship and what's on my mind but I'm not sure if this is a good idea. Should I just drop it or still give it a shot? I deeply miss her and I can't seem to get over her no matter how hard I try to. Also -- if you think I should do the audio thing -- do you have any advice on what to say and what not to say? I'd really appreciate it.**Friend dumps problems on me and that’s all we do together now Interested in other peoples experience of this and suggestions!	0
When I was a freshman in college I had this same problem -- absolutely zero friends and living in a totally different city. It was the worst depression I've ever been through. I had dozens and dozens of online friends at the time (now we've all lost touch and moved on from the RPG we were playing) that helped ease the loneliness, and I eventually joined a student club and finally made friends after like a year of going. There's not really anything I can "join" like that in a non-college town... I've been applying for a few volunteering things, they haven't started but I'm doubtful that it will be a good way to meet people.	1

I’m A.M. and I’m writing to introduce a new initiative named YourAmigo. Basically we are a group of friends that have to decided to form this initiative to help anyone who need an “amigo” (Spanish word for friend).

We don’t accept donations, though if anyone wants to help us or has any suggestions, feel free to contact us.	1

So that's my experience. After a week, I came out feeling better. I got off of Wellbutrin after determining it could be the cause of my increased depression. The Abilify gives me energy to get up and not be stuck in bed all day. I feel better than when I went in.	1
It messed me up. Even affected my first two relationships. I got with my first girlfriend solely because she liked me. Part of me hoped my best friend would get jealous. I genuinely liked my second girlfriend and she liked me. This girl gave me the butterflies, but because neither of us made a real effort to be boyfriend and girlfriend, we didn't last. Before, after, and sometimes during each of these relationships, I would wish it was my best friend (I know, a dick move).	1
You: haha. idk how to be happy fuckin hell	1
I know I'm going to spiral further, it's inevitable, but I'm trying to prepare.	1
I am a fake.	1
My trauma happened when i was 8, I'm now 18 and still suffer from it daily. I actually suppressed the trauma completely until I was 12, when it all came back to me; so I guess I've only really been dealing with it for 6 years now.	1
I myself stopped taking antidepressants cold turkey as well (that was about 5 years ago) and I’m still depressed but not to the point where I can’t go out and do what I’m supposed to like she is experiencing right now. I love her and want to be with her forever but I don’t know how to help at this point, she’s not receptive to my help and hates herself and has no friends where she lives, a small town in Canada.Sometimes I just get hit so hard by realizing I've lost out on most of my life. "Castle on the hill" got me messed up Don't know why the song suddenly got to me, I've heard and seen it before but now it makes me so sad. I never had that, I don't have friends I could go to, get back to, I just have nobody. After half of my life I wouldn't say I'm depressed anymore, but now I have to deal with the fallout of years and years and years of digging myself in a hole, I have to start everything over. I have no foundation to build on. I feel sad, maybe a little fearful that I will never manage to achieve that genuine bonding and feeling of belonging I could have gotten in my teens.	1
I kinda just wish i knew where i went wrong. I just feel so unattractive and like there's something wrong with me. I know this probably sounds really petty and unimportant but it really hurts and I just needed to vent.Does anyone else feel like life is maybe too long? I don't know what it is, but just having to face so many days of the same things, even if you switch it up once in a while, it's all so boring and monotonous. I find it difficult keeping myself entertained. I feel like I'm at a party where I was having fun at first, but now things are starting to die down and I just want to go home, aka be dead already. Just a thought I've been having. Have a good night."i had nothing to offer anyone except my own confusion" Omegle chat with stranger about life You're now chatting with a random stranger. Say hi!	1
Then i was on my 18, i had finished a test if i was join the military as a seargent or if i was enter like a corporal and I WAS SUCEED \o/ . But on the other hands, Kim, that i had met 6 months ago was  through a rough part of her life, she had lost her job, she wasn't paying the bills and was about to get dumped from the house she was living (all alone) and then, i talked to my parents if i could help her by inviting her to come home with us, i was about to change my life, i was about to work twice as hard and so i did.	1
I'm turning 19 soon, and I've never had a girlfriend, still a virgin and I'm probably going to die alone. I'm not fat or anything, i'm just a skinny guy by nature, I understand that If I want a girlfriend, I should work on myself but I just can't live with the fact that I wasted my youth being a shut in. The shame is unbearable, I want to erase any evidence of my existence, my punishment for failure will be death by hanging, this is my last resort. Death over defeat.It's not that I think people wouldn't care if I die - it's that I don't think they care that I'm here. I just feel tired of everything I always feel so tired of doing any work or any other form of interaction. I'm tired of school, I'm tired of feeling inadequate compared to my friends who are moving on to bigger and better things, I'm tired of feeling like a disappointment to my family, and I'm tired of the shitty life I feel like I have. Yet the thing I'm most tired of is being unable to find any consistent motivation in my life, never truly feeling motivated to do or finish anything, just letting any and everything just pass me by.	1
I hope this inspires others to talk about it, seek help and be open to receiving it. It was quite uncomfortable but I am happy to create an opening for other people to understand what we are going through.	1
Take a moment and try to enjoy this.  Feel the sun's light on your beautiful face. Take a nap on the earth soft grass.  Smell the flowers and enjoy your favorite food.  It's important to take a break and just take things slow for a moment.	1
Only I find that whenever I spend time with a friend, they end up annoying the shit out of me. Each one for a different reason. One talks about herself too much, one is too positive and gushy, one only ever talks about the past, the other only wants to hang out and drink. When I’m with them, I just find myself wishing I could be alone.	1
Feeling alone, just wanna run away from everything. Hello to the community, I feel like I’m lost and alone that no one can help me. It started when I was around 15 and now I’m 20. I can’t sleep at the night, my head is so full of think everything and nothing at the same time. I just wanna run away from everything from everybody. I don’t have Plans for my future job, I’m studying at a college and don’t even know what to do after that. I just want everything to end.. I also have moments of stress where I just feel like I’m passing out and the doctor don’t find anything. What am I supposed to do ?Sad all the time and abusing many drugs to try n stay alive Hi, I've had depression n anxiety for a few years now, had ups n downs but mainly downs, it's got to the point where I use weed, md, xans, ket n alcohol to fill up the holes.	1
It's really screwing with my coursework and making my mental and physical health worse. People keep giving me reasonable advice like turning off distractions and forcing myself to go to bed, or even staying up the whole day so I'm very tired by nighttime, but I just can't find the willpower to go to sleep or get up. I'm not motivated to do anything anymore that I don't have to do. I'm starting to feel like a complete failure.	1
I am behind on adulthood. I have only recently acquired a driver’s license, I just renewed my glasses prescription and only just started living on my own. I have to get my teeth taken care of and they are a source of stress and physical pain (still have wisdom teeth at 34). I have the habits of a teenager. I smoke copious amounts of weed, I drink daily and I don’t pursue my interests or goals. I know the right course of action most of the time, but I actively ignore it because the amount required to get healthy is just too much. I have spent a great majority of my life single and most of my relationships aside from a few gems have been tumultuous, emotional rollercoasters. More often than not, Despite all these things I feel undervalued in my society. I think of myself as smart, funny and confident in my skills, but I feel that the rest of the world doesn’t care and doesn’t see those as appealing. I feel like without looks and an academic education, you can only accomplish so much and that people’s standards are so high that competition for a good role in society is unlikely. I feel unable to compete when the above issues prevent me from succeeding. Motivation to do anything is lowered by the lack of acceptance in general, the feeling that I should be acceptable the way I am but am not, and my inability to seem to control that situation. It doesn’t help that on the face of it, most people will tell me that I seem like a “catch”, an incredibly high-value person with lots to offer—except that none of that seems to translate to my life, emotional attachments or stability.	1
But i felt peace, i felt pleasure. So I KNOW those are real.	1
At this point, medication is my last resort. I've had a girlfriend and it made no difference whatsoever, I still feel empty most of the time and would rather die than anything else.	1
Can't see any friends as I live so far away and my family simply don't know how to support me.	1
For example, I saw one of my former bullies enter the store I work at. She was absolutely terrible toward me when we were in high school, such as defacing my sketchbook, purposefully kicking my food away, sending me fake "love letters", and more. Anyway, the bully now had two children (I'm having trouble conceiving so that stings), and I think the bully could smell my fear because she headed right to my counter, and began to make a show of how expensive everything was in our store while also "catching up" by telling me about how successful she is with her self made interior design business.	1
I saw him a week later in hospice. He was catatonic. I told him it was okay to let go, okay to move on if he was in pain. They say hearing is the final sense to go. He died thirty minutes after I left.	1
I fucking despise my job though, so I can't bring myself to actually do the work. I procrastinate for hours/days and only get anything done by pulling all-nighters right before deadlines. I could have an assignment for two weeks and I will still do it from 2:00 am to 7:00 am the night before it's due. The procrastination makes me even more depressed, anxious, stressed, etc., which makes me even less interested in doing my work. I know I would be less miserable if I got my shit together, but I just can't make myself do it, and then I hate myself even more. Vicious cycle continues.	1
As soon as I heard all the voices calling Senua names, putting her down, laughing at her etc. I was like holy shit that was me. I am not trying to say I have/had psychosis, I just thought that the voices thing felt like what I went through. My voice, telling me terrible things, spinning stories, like someone else in my head, working against me.	1
So here’s my idea. Just for fun I livestream games on YouTube. I do it for fun, not for fame, I don’t play those popular games, I play the ones that no one plays. It’s unlikely for a video to get more than 100 views. But I’ve considered starting a new channel. I will livestream games, post videos about my custom Guitar Hero songs (I do that for fun too) and just pretty much show that I’m having fun. But the big goal of the channel will be to “get my friend back”. That’ll be the whole idea. That will be written on every video. That’s what the channel art will say. Think of it as a gofundme, only I’m not asking for money, I’m asking for support from the public to hear my story, hear what I’m doing, and to be there with me when my friend does deliver.	1
You’ve been to hell and back, and I might as well have been the chauffeur for a good portion of it.	1
Think of your loneliness. Think of you inexistant social life. You are 25 and you have no job. You are living with your boring mother, with whom you literally quarel with every day. She probably think you are a piece of shit. You never had any girlfriend, and you probably won't. Almost 26, don't count on me to congratulate you...	1
Thank you so much! If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment in this thread.	0
I just don’t see a path out of this pointless existence that I feel capable of taking. I feel like I’m just serving a sentence, going through the motions until it’s mercifully done.	1
-&gt; Try not to worry about the neighbour kids and how they are probably getting abused	1
So yeah. There’s my rant.I am always wrong.. I got married with a wrong man.  I have been married for 5 years. I have a baby who is still a month. I realized that i chose the wrong person as husband. He ruined my life. He ruined my inside. He cheats on me while i was pregnant. But he does not think he did bad things to me. When i said something, he always says that I'm stupid or crazy. He thinks he's right. Since last year, we moved to his country and living with his mother and sister. Because he works there. His family are nice to me. But my husband doesn't come back every day.. I have a baby but he doesn't support me. I haven't realized he's such a bad man.. He has hidden so many things from me.. So i thought he's a good husband. But he brought financial issues. And i have helped it. But he forgot that.. I want to leave him but i don't have money and i have a baby.. And I'm in different country.. No one is by my side. I cut myself almost every day. I have stopped it since i was 20. But situations make me do that. I would never wear short sleeve again. Too much scars. But i don't regret to cut myself. Because that's the only way to make me live. Maybe people say easy that i should get a divorce or just leave him or ask my family. But that's not easy.  I have tried to end my life many times after i moved here. But I'm failed. I hope one day i can be gone. Life is so unfair. I don't want to live this life anymore. I want someone to kill me.. Feeling Trapped Hello,	1

Just here to vent I can't stop thinking about suicide and it's making it hard to do anything I cant get these thoughts of suicide out of my head. The word just keeps popping up in my head. I keep thinking of where I could go, or what effect it would have. I can't get it out of my head. I've been staring at reddit doing absolutely nothing because every time i do something it keeps coming up again and it just distracts me until im slumped in my chair staring or lying on the ground. I used to smoke weed all the time, I like to think it helped me ignore my depression, but it really just made my depression make me more useless than i already am. I don't see the any sort of happy ending to my life. The happiest i can see myself attain is dying alone with a self-published book thats gone unread till I die, then maybe someone will read it. I dont see myself ever finding love, I see friends leaving every minute, every conversation I have with family only makes them hate me more. I try so hard everyday. I feel like im the only one trying. I adapt to my friends, they never pay me mind. I adapt to my family, they dont pay me mind. Its easier staying in my room all day. Where I don't have to exhaust myself in adapting to everyone. Where I don't fuck everything up.	1
I am 32. My short and sweet backstory is that I lost the love of my life because of alcoholism and depression. The way we broke up was the worst thing to happen to any person. She basically called the police on her way home from work, had me put in jail for a week on false charges and since I moved out of the state I couldn't call my family while I was incarcerated and charges eventually dropped. It broke me so terribly that I literally split personalities.	1
The last 3 days were the happiest days of my life. It feels like I actually live for the first time. But i also got depressed since. I got depressed because i couldn't recall her image. I couldnt recall her face. I couldn't recall what she looked like when we first met. And i couldnt remember why those were the happiest days of my life. I just recall those were the happiest. All i can recall is a brief moment of her smile for like 5-10 secs, her voice, and the moment when we were about to say good bye that i poured out my heart. Everything is so blurry.	1
i have shit i’ve got to do that i was supposed to do last weekend, but also spent that weekend in bed (you’re terrible in bed btw), and considering that i’m writing this at 6am instead of sleeping like i was supposed to start doing several hours ago - after i was supposed to take the meds that i didn’t get up to take - the forecast for today is pretty bleak as well.	1
Eventhough it feels useless I might go to a psychologist. How has it helped you guys? I wan’t to end it all but I don’t want to end it all. I don’t know. I feel lost and sinking deeper every damn time. Have no life I feel like as if I have no life besides the fantasies I’ve created in my head. I picture myself in a couple years as this perfect happy person with a booming social life and a good job. I create scenarios where everything is just perfect and everybody loves me. It makes me happy to daydream about this but certain stuff happens and I realize how I am in real life. Just makes me sadHow do I deal with feeling worthless? I’ve had a bad day and this is on top of just a long few years of my life where I can’t remember the last time I’ve truly been happy. I have a few friends but the more my life has gone on, the more I’ve realized certain dislikings i have towards them. I want to meet new people and do new things, something that my friends aren’t interested in or don’t have time for. I’m as bad as you could imagine when it comes to making new friends because I can be really socially awkward and I’m convinced that few other people share specific interests that I would look for in friends or a girlfriend. I have few (if any) aspirations in life and I just feel like I’m drifting through life without any idea what I want. I don’t feel like I’ve accomplished much in my life, I’m in college but I’ve never held a job before and I’m hardly passionate enough about a career to really be interested to want to pursue it. Maybe this sounds like a really pathetic post but I honestly don’t know what to do. I just feel alone and unmotivated to do anything in life.college- medical withdrawal for a semester Okay, so I'm thinking about either doing a course load reduction or a medical withdrawal due to my anxiety and depression. I've already contacted my academic advisor and the financial aid office, but I honestly have no idea whether everything will work out or not. If I manage to get a course load reduction, does anyone have any ideas for things I can do to help myself get better during this semester? If it ends up not working out, does anyone know about other ways I can go about making this semester less stressful?	1
So I’m a 19 year old guy, I’ve never had a serious relationship with a girl before.	1
Don't worry, whoever reads this. I'm not gonna off myself. Not yet, at least. No ones gonna read this.	1
“Sir, I exist!”	1
What’s more stigmatising? Telling people they have biologically broken brains with insufficient brain chemistry, and bad genes? Psychiatrists/psychotherapist within the biopsycho model of human emotions, only drug, or involuntarily “hopstialise” people	1
I believe i have major depression and i have visited psychologist and psychiatrist who have advised me to take antidepressants.	1
I've been building a friendship with a great girl from work (call her Amy) for a few months. It doesn't seem like anything romantic is gonna come from it, but it was nice to have a friend I could do stuff with. We went hiking, rock climbing, we even went on a scuba trip to the Caribbean together. I'd opened up to her about my depression and she seemed really understanding. She actually seemed to appreciate how open and communicative I was about it.	1
For the record Yea I do see a psychiatrist, a therapist and have a great support system. It just sucks because even with all that I am losing thus battle.	1
Sometimes we need to let things go. The people who are your friends will never say stuff like this. Ending a friendship - am I overreacting? I'm looking for advice from impartial people.	0
"Nobody cares what I have to say anyway."	1
I was consumed with darkness, but there was a small flicker of light, of hope. I wanted to help people, I wanted to one day to change the world, or at the very least change one person’s life. I wasn’t ready to leave just yet, so I held on to the tiny amount of hope that was left in me. I called the cops and was admitted into a psychiatric center. I spent 48 hours in a white walled, emotionless, prison like place. And not once did someone ask me if I was okay.	1
Flash forward to today: My therapist guided me through a meditation today that instructed me to visualize and speak to a younger version of myself. I described what I looked like, what characteristics defined me, and how I saw myself. Then I was instructed to, as myself as the adult I've become, speak to that child and tell him what I was feeling.	1
If you read this thanks for reading.My goal in life is to finally feel safe I'm at my boyfriends house. Been here a few days. I stay here every so often to escape my unstable home life, and hes all I have.	1
This is the usual happening on this sub, op posts "i feel like shit because I have no friends"/ "life sucks" /"I want to feel normal" and other redditors reply with "yeah same" /"i understand"/"I feel like shit too".	1
Doing it secretly will be risky because I actually work in my family's business as well so my tight schedule and the fact that my town is pretty small makes this almost impossible. And if someone finds out I secretly go to talk to a doctor it will have even worse reaction than just straight out telling them.	1
What do I even do? I'm withdrawing from stims myself, and I feel completely useless and hopeless. I'm too lazy to be suicidal these days, but I don't enjoy life anymore. I cry all the time. I live in my head. I don't know what I can gain from posting here, but someone... please help.It never ends Some days I just wish I would get hit by a car or never wake up. Today is my birthday and I'm turning 22 and I feel like such a loser. I'm a moody, anxious, depressed piece of shit and I know my friends and family are sick of me and would be better off without me. I haven't accomplished anything with my life, I feel I'm stuck in the same place as I was when I was 18. I relapsed and cut myself last month, probably did the most damage to myself then I ever did. I want to die. I want to talk about it with someone but I'm scared I'll be put into a hospital. And I know how much it would kill my mom if I hurt myself or if I told her I want to die. isnt it kind of crazy when people who actually are not clinically depressed say they want to die or are depressed for fun, when you are really dealing with those feelings for real? There are people at my work place who clearly are not clinically depressed but tag and share memes like they are lonely or depressed or just say they want to die in a funny way, when everyday is a huge challenge for me in terms of forcing myself to be alive and conform to the societal norms. This usually never gets to me because many people dont actually get what it means to be depressed. Even depressed people experience things in a spectrum. However, when I feel like I am falling off the wagon and I see these seemingly normal treat suicidal thoughts/coping mechanisms of genuinely depressed people/melancholy as fun memes and have a good laugh when all those things are part my own personal hell, I just go completely bonkers and I do not really know why.	1
—I’m constantly moody. My emotions change with the drop of a hat. —I’m constantly wondering why my husband stays with me (he is a GREAT GREAT supporting, caring lover) and am always thinking he deserves better —I hate waking up on the weekends because I feel like I have no purpose (my almost-three year old is pretty easy to manage despite being rambunctious) —I am too self conscious to even get out and do something if I know the place I want to go to will be crowded —I have NO motivation to do anything. Walking to get some fresh air? Nope. Getting out of the house just for a moment to change scenery? Not a chance. —Everything that I try to do I have NO attention span to continue.	1
My life goals can be summed up in saying I want to find my “person” have a kid or two, and do what I can to make them and myself happy. I just honestly don’t see the path to that reality, though. Nothing matters to me anymore. Just my parents, and I can honestly say that I am 100% safe as long as they’re around because I care more about them than myself. However, if they were gone tomorrow, I think I’d be close behind.	1
Sadly, it's another day and I have to get out of bed.Do you ever feel like why bother we’re all going to die anyhow and all we’ve accomplished and done will be forgotten? I enjoy art, but I often think why bother. I’ll die one day and all my art work will be thrown away. There’s a lot I do enjoy but none of it serves any purpose. After you go on vacation for example you’re just left with the memories, until you get old and forget it all. Sure it was fun at the moment but serves no long term purpose and one day even the memories will be gone. They say enjoy life but why? Animals don’t. They just do what they do. They’re only purpose is to keep their species alive and technically that’s our only purpose in life to keep our species going. Maybe if we didn’t spend so much time focusing on life and enjoying it we’d actually be happier people and more accepting of pending doom. I don’t know, that’s just how I feel most of the time. Why I even bother to write this or anything else on Reddit I don’t know. The grass isn't green anywhere; the grass is fucking dead I don't give a damn about what people say about the grass being green on the other side or where you water it or whatever. It doesn't matter. NOTHING will satisfy me. Maybe I expect too much from the world, but when I put the work in (something seen few and far between these days), I just want some form of pride or happiness or something. The grass is dead. It is, it has been, and it always will be. This small existence will never mean anything.What are you amazing at? Seriously? And, I don't want to hear no bullshit like, "driving people away", or things like that. I am trying to promote self-esteem and value in your own eyes. So take this opportunity to brag about yourself. Just try to keep it positive. I want you to reflect on what makes you a champion. Because, make no mistake.... We are all Champions!I just had an abortion. I haven't been feeling right mentally lately. I'm used to feeling numb because i have depression so i know what its like to feel like shit, but i cant really describe i how feel right now and to be honest i think thats a bad thing. I know that i made the right choice but..i didn't think that at 18 i would be making this choice. At 18, i should be getting ready for college and figuring out my major not mourning the death of my child. I feel like such a loser. All my friends and family are getting ready to start this new and exciting chapter in their lives and I'm in my room crying like an idiot because not only did i have an abortion but i also just lost my shitty part time job. So now I'm broke and emotionally drained. great.How do I get confidence and motivation? Anyone else not accomplish anything in their life? I'm a loner, loser, and I don't fit in anywhere. I'm only 17 but I should have done something with my life by now. Never played sports, never got a job, never had real friends, never had confidence just anxiety (I believe this to be a major factor that prevents me from doing things). Stay home all day on PS4, no motivation, no happiness, no passions, and no dreams. Most would say they look forward to getting out of high school yet I'm the opposite. I don't look forward to the future. I don't want to go to college although I probably will anyways, and I don't want to work a job I'll hate. I'm a lazy shit and I hate myself for it.Every-time I look in the mirror. I see somebody else. I don't know who I am anymore, it's like I'm a stranger in my own body. Help, I'm not sure if my partner is depressed. I need help moving forward. A little background on my partner and our relationship, he's 23 and I'm 21. He lost his mother to sickness when he was 17 years old, dropped out of school because of that and moved away to complete a foundation course. We met while he was back home but he currently studies overseas to complete his bachelor's degree. However, he's been home for the past 2.5 weeks as he is having his semester break.	1
Anyone has experience in dealing with such friends? Depressed friends who smiles all the time? It sounds weird to ask what I can do for you, because she normally won't respond (at least I think so). What should I (or should not) say to her?friend help I’m in community college and I have some friends but they’re all very busy now with either relationships or other friends. I feel very lonely what do I do to make new friends? How do I get over a friendship? Hi all, I have gotten over people in the past... but having trouble here.  The problem is that they treat all their other friends so good - but not me.  So, it just hurts even more to get over this (I am the one ending the friendship because of how they treat me).  I think I could get over it, if they were just a jerk or a bad friend - but they're not.  They're just a bad friend to me.  Any advice would be so helpful just to read and know maybe I'm not alone with the kind of pain.bad friend I’ve been friends with this guy for a few months now. At first things were really great and he was a really good friend, but the past two months he’s been a major DICK. I’ve been keeping my distance and not really talking to him as much. I have 3 weeks to either fix this failing friendship or get rid of it. I’ve decided that if it doesn’t get better in the next week, i will spend the following week trying to get rid of this friendship, and the third week dealing with the aftermath. I just don’t know how to, if i need to, end this friendship without being a major dick in return. He’s friends with a lot of people in my friend “network” perse and is even dating one of my best friends, so i want to leave him on good terms as to not cause any problems. advice?I moved 2,000 miles away for college six years ago. Parents have never visited I'm unsure how to feel.  I moved to the other side of the country (USA) six years ago because I was accepted to a wonderful school in California.  My parents aren't too wealthy but are firmly middle class.  I could not afford to trac back home because I was barely living paycheck to paycheck until recently.  I paid for everything myself - textbooks, housing, transportation.  Of course, they helped out a bit as holiday gifts, but I've never received a care package or any extra aid.	0
-&gt; I do not exist.Insurance for therapy? I have decided to look into getting a therapist to deal with issues of depression and anxiety. I'm still on my parents insurance plan which should cover most of the cost. However, I've heard it can be a bad idea to use insurance to pay for therapy as insurance companies can audit your sessions to see if you still require them to keep paying for it. I am concerned about privacy and having trouble getting insured in the future with mental health issues on my record, but paying out of pocket is not a great option either as I'm currently a broke college student. Anyone have a similar situation? episodes once or twice a month i have these what you may call severe depression episodes where the thoughts of suicide fill every part of my brain. my heart starts beating extremely fast and i cant keep my eyes off of my meds just lying around on the table.  my mind is full of questions such as, should i do it? what would happen if i took all my meds right now? is it that easy? will everything be over then? am i going to just stop existing? then i start bawling my eyes out and cry myself to sleep. i know im probably not going kill myself, at least any time soon. im too scared of it. its just that i feel like im in a neverending cycle and im really tired of it.Tomorrow is my 35th birthday. So tomorrow is my 35th birthday. I really thought I would have a family,  have a husband or wife and just be happy having this awesome life.  Nope. At 35, I am miserably in debt,  unhappy,  no family and I'm very far from all of my friends.  So,  yay I guess.  First instinct when I wake up is to immediately try to go back to sleep to avoid the crushing anxiety and depression Anyone else immediately try to go back to sleep as they are conscious? I'm like "no, Not this fucking shit agin" sleep is the only relief I get but that's obviously not sustainable. I really don't know what to do anymore, don't even know how I'm alive at this point.If a flame gets extinguished in the middle of the night And no one sees it. Was anything really lost? Surely everything can continue as just before. Maybe a little less brighter. But continue nonethelessCould use some random, late night friends I've started a prescription and it's at least two weeks for it to build but in the past week I've had nothing. Waiting a week until I can request an increase in dose.	1
This morning I was taking a shower sitting down with the lights off - I know, pretty edgy behavior, but it's my way of unwinding and resetting myself between bouts of work.	1
You beg it to stop, as the throbbing in your heart grows stronger. But it's not gonna stop, no matter how hard you beg.	1
I don't know. I enjoy escapism probably to a fault, but it's the only way for me to feel at least a little relevant. I'll probably come to terms with my role as human being #6,732,385,402 someday. Many thanks to anybody who bothered to read this wall of text.  finals are coming up and im gonna fail im failing two classes (physics with a 27 and american lit with a 67) and i have no motivation to do anything and i have been thinking about cutting again.Today I realized I don't have any friends. Not really. This weekend I was going to go to a Harry Potter symphony with my two aunts. One of them and my grandma, who all live together, got sick. They gave me the three tickets. They told me to go with friends,  but they don't want to chance getting me sick or no one staying with their mom.	1
Stranger: either that or id attempt to get pain meds	1
It gets better, I was really lost, was hoping i would die and I found my cure. Maybe your cure won’t be someone else, maybe it’ll be medicine or yourself but please don’t give up because i would have regretted it so much. The world has so much more to offerHad a good dream, then I woke up Last night I had a really good dream. The type of dream that makes you think “fuck it, maybe I won’t kill myself.” I was with someone, probably an s/o, and there wasn’t anything going on but everything was at peace. Then my grandmother woke me up for a breakfast that everyone argued over, even with a goddamn three year old. Nothing changed, I just had a bullshit dream that’ll never really happen. Small rant, but the friend I normally talk to is asleep or busy.It's my cakeday today. Idk why but it makes me happyYou ever hated yourself so much.. That you make it a constant effort to avoid any mirrors or reflections of yourselfHow are you? I am not okay. I’m in a kind of adverse situation, my thoughts are all over the place and I really don’t know how to break this cycle. Basically what happened was that a few days ago, I sent my best friend a message before school, saying that I wouldn’t attend classes because I wasn’t feeling too well, that I felt like giving up and that, in case I also wouldn’t have been at school the following day, I had probably killed myself. I wasn’t joking. Sometimes I get these sort of “impulses”, most likely caused by me being overwhelmed by my emotions, my thoughts, and as a result of that, it feels as though I lose my common sense, my ability to think rationally. My thought patterns become unpredictable, but so far I’ve managed to not act on them, or else I wouldn’t be writing this right now. Currently they’ve been happening a lot more frequently than usual and that seriously freaks me out because during those times death seems like such a good solution to my problems. So, back to the story. Obviously, my friend got really concerned and encouraged me to come to her place because she’d been staying at home that day. BUT she also contacted my mom, which I didn’t know until hours later, and told her that I wasn’t at school and made a concerning remark, but I don’t know exactly. My mom started to call me like every minute and I started to panic because I thought a teacher had called her, so I didn’t pick up any of her calls. I spent the rest of the day with my friend, but called my mom in the afternoon. She asked my where I was and it sounded like she was crying and I told her that I was at my friends place, but after that she declined the call. That night I slept at my dads place, my mom called him and told him that she didn’t care anymore about what I was doing and that kind of hit me. It was the last thing I wanted to hear in that situation. I just don’t know what to do. I really do feel miserable. My friend is beating herself up because she thinks it’s all her fault and I don’t know, I just feel bad for feeling bad, if you know what I mean. That message was a cry of help in a kind of way and I don’t understand why my mom reacted the way she did. It just makes me think that maybe everyone is really better off without me. I’ve been depressed for nearly five years now, but my mom never really paid attention to it and just marked me down as lazy. I’ve been doing great for a good six months in 2017, but then somebody really important to me, somebody that kept me going, passed away in December and since then everything had taken a turn for the worse. Life has become so hard for me, I’m sleeping the days away because I can’t bear the thoughts, the guilt, because I’m too much of a coward to face reality. I’m trying, I really am, but no matter what I do, this feeling, this feeling that eradicates my will to live, remains.My best is not enough. Ok, so here is the situation: I broke up with my ex five months ago. As soon as we ended our thing, I started running everyday, eating healthy food only, and going to the gym. 1h30min of HEAVY exercise everyday. I did this until this very day. I lost fucking 15kg (my weight at the start was 90kg, now 75kg). I also bought green contact lenses to wear, and even sunbathe. I invested so much time (and money) to improve myself and look amazing and no. one. noticed.! I look at the mirror and I am happy with my results. Then, the moment I exit my house:BOOM. 4 months thrown into the trash. No one cares. It makes no difference.  The women I'm attracted still do not find me attractive. It pisses me off how I imagine they won't survive just one week of my training. They can't see how hard I worked to change. I downloaded Tinder,even saw my EX there, wrote a BIO describing myself (I still find myself interesting. People, don't) and I got nearly 0 matches. Now I'm stuck in an Alcohol /Cigarette/Party/OneNightStandGirls loop and I can't get out of it. I drink so much that I can't even remember some things. I have fun, yes. But I want to have a connection with someone again. Is it asking too much? Why people don't give a chance to know me??? I think things could get better I just recently posted about how I thought all things were awful and ranted about feelings and stuff, and well, idk what came over me but I think things may get better? At least I hope so! It’s long overdue if it does, but I guess I can’t complain. I feel a sense of hope I haven’t felt in a long time. I hope this feeling lasts...	1
I know that I am in a big mess. I disgust myself for my lack of energy and determination to do anything. But then when I'm faced with the colossal task at hand, I'd chicken out, then I'd sleep on it, hoping that everything would somehow sort themselves out, only to find myself wake up in the next morning groggy and lethargic. Nothing has changed, and I'm still deep in depression. My struggle I barely get out of bed, I lost my job because I got to depressed to go in, My family don’t speak to me because they don’t believe in how depressed I am, I’ve distanced myself from all my friends they don’t even check up on me anymore.	1
I just kind of threw away all the good prospects in my life over the course of a week and have been feeling like a piece of crap. Probably not news to anyone here, that's how it usually goes. But tonight I feel okay. I recently decided just to drop everything and run away (not the first time I've done it, I've gotten good at it actually) and have been just sitting while I wait for finances to become ready.	1
Stranger: so hed have to stay with me	1
I took antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg before this during 8 months for major stress and it helped me with almost no side effects.	1
I have no friends. In fact, during 2017, I was so excited to have made a great friend and I was completely betrayed by them. The kind of betrayal where I walked away from a friendship and haven’t bothered reading the apologies they’ve sent me. I’ve tried reconnecting with friend that I had earlier in life, but I’m not doing so well. I feel like they will do something to me and then I’ll lose another friend. And logically, if I’m the only common factor in all my failed friendships, then I must be the problem, right? I must be the problem. I’m the problem. Maybe I’m not meant to have friends.	1
Stranger: living on the street because of not having money, or another reason?	1
Fuck this shit.	1
I moved out after much arguing and for the first time I was free to be the person I knew I could be, I made so many new friends i gained weight for the first time I was always independent and knew I was happy. Like actually happy.	0
EDIT 1: Thank you all so much for the wishes, it really means a lot. this is the most i've gotten in years. Really made my day, been struggling to cope especially in the last few months, everything is just hitting like a train so thank you to all! Wish you all a good day :)	1
It would explain post natal depression. It's one of the worst times of your life,  horrible things happen,  it's gross. But people tell you you're meant to be happy. How could you be with a screaming baby and no sleep?  Do you feel like a burden to other people? I do. I'm 18. When people make me feel bad about myself or control me in a way I don't like or just get annoyed with me just talking to them I tend to feel really depressed, sad and think of how I wish I wasn't born. I already stuggle to keep and make friends. It hurts me a lot. Makes me sad. It kills me mentally. People just hurt me so much. I don't think I can cope anymore honestly..... Drank too much and ended up in the hospital Let me start this off by saying I’m underage, so that just makes this just so much better.	1
I’ve been chronically depressed for years but I’m finally going to seek professional help Monday. I’ve been having suicidal tendencies for years and if I ever have kids, which I very much hope I do one day, I’ll be damned if they feel they can’t come to me to talk about any bad thoughts. people making a mockery of depression makes me more depressed they treat it like its a fairytale people take it too light. I dont want to open up anymore to people I rather bottle it up and have my weekly breakdownsI wish I won't wake up when I go to sleep tonight I got tons of acquaintances but not friends. I wish I have someone to talk to, about things I like, things I'm passionate about. It doesn't help that I'm aloof and unfriendly.	1
So recently my parents have been on me (M 17) about getting a job, getting college information, SAT information, getting my licence and spending more time with the family. Tonight they both came at me and yelled about how I wasn't going to amount to anything and that I pretty much am ruining their current lives. They threw so much at me that it broke me and I broke down in the bathroom.	1
I really don't know what I want to do or what I even can do. Add onto more shallow but personal reasons for me to feel down, like the fact that I have no social life to speak of and honestly it's enough to make me seriously consider suicide. It all just feels hopeless to me, and I don't even really feel like living to see what the future holds because it feels as though it's all bleak in the long term.I don't act depressed so people just think I'm edgy™ I'm pretty good at keeping up appearances in public but I do make the occasional depression joke, so when I tell those jokes or share a meme about suicide people think I'm making light of depression or laughing at suicidal people. But honestly I can't remember the last time I went a day without wanting to kill myself haha. But then again you can't really reach out to anyone without being that "depressing friend" and the college therapist is pretty shit so here I ammmmmmmmI hate my boring, routine life. I’m accomplishing nothing, I’m not living. I’m simply existing. I am so sick of getting up and working 9-5 five days a week. My job stresses me out so much that I can’t unwind and relax in the few hours I have to myself a day, my weekends are full of errands that I can’t do during the week because of working, I have no hobbies and I have no energy in any free time I have to start some. I don’t make enough money to really have any experiences, I’m so bored. I can’t take time off work even though I have PTO because the amount of work I have to catch up on even missing one day is unreal and it stresses me out more to miss work than it does to be there.	1
There’s no point to any of this, no ultimate conclusion. I’m not looking for advice or friendship, I just needed someone out there to know how desperately I long for that final sleep.	1
Thanks for readingI'm getting tired of this world mentally and physically... I am at my wits end I'm stressing, reliving painful memories and always everyone's second choice. No one really cares they say it but it's not true. My depersonalization just makes it worse. I feel disconnected from everyone and everything including my family and girlfriendNo one is gonna read this Nobody likes me and every time I interact on reddit i tend to be a laughstock and receive a bunch of downvotes, because I'm a worthless piece of shit that shouldn't even be breathing. Just wish to be happy but that's impossible, my only purpose is to choke on a fat dick and die because i'm a faggotBursting into tears at pigeon dying So one effect of my depression is I get really, really, really sad about some things. I just saw a pigeon get hit by the bus I’d just gotten off of; when I went to help it, it got hit by another car and I head it’s skull smash. I am absolutely devastated and can’t stop myself crying at work. I just need my spirit to settle In its totality it doesn't have to be about wins and loses,  or what I failed to do.  Neither does it have to be about my past years and the thoughts that come with immense feelings that appears to haunt me.  The behaviors and mentality that I have doesn't have to be the end all be all.  One major thing to include that its not about growth or conquering something in life.  I'm not living to grow or to become strong after a catastrophic situation.  I am looking for my spirit to simply just settle.  I'm not seeking any advice nor trying to raise my fist towards challenges.  I'm not seeking any of that just a settling of the inner me.  To me,  that is important than anything else because I would gladly be able to live with that when I one day be out of this earth. I'm not the goal oriented type.  Its not about climbing this ladder of life. I'm not here for any of what most people are striving for.  I seek for my spirit to settle for all these years.  That is what I'm chasing.  Most people are chasing dreams,  families,  success,  marriages,  money,  respect,  and fame,  but not this human.  More power to them and I'm sure they will obtain all those things but I for one am not seeking to obtain.  The human game is a serious thing filled with losses and wins.  I don't wanna count anymore nor try to get to the next level of life.  Cycling through the infinite regrets and regression. The only goal is for this spirit to settle some type of way.  I'm gunning for an internal calmness.  Something that can penetrate and flood the mind of mine.  Something that can provide some internal at ease like affect for myself.  So I say to my spirit,  I hope you settle.  Torn. Need advice... Hey Reddit. I am not sure how to start all this but im going to explain to my best ability. Here goes. So, i have i had depression and anxiety give or take 3 years. I recently opened up about it to my girlfriend and she encouraged me to open up about it to my mother. I told her about almost everything. The one thing i did not mention to her was the... suicidal thoughts. Now, for our family “feelings” isnt our thing. We keep everything closed up and then repress it all. Thats what i have been doing for years not just with depression but everything. Now, these past three days have been brutal on me. I had no want to leave my bed or eat or even sleep. I just lay there and listen to music. I have been having suicial thoughts here and there these past three days. I will have happy moments here and there. But it doesnt last (shocker) and i just go back to feeling like pure awfulness. So, I am a 17 y/o male and I start senior year in August. We are a military family. My dream is the military. Thats all i have ever wanted. I want to follow my brothers footsteps because he is a total badass. All ive ever talked about to people, when they ask me what i want, to do is how badly i want to join the military. I do not think, with my current mental state, that i should go to the military. But i also fully believe that if i dont go i will disappoint everyone around me and they will be disgusted in me and i also believe that i will fall deeper into this dark hole i have been in. I have come to ask you guys, Any ideas on what to do? I am taking a cross country trip in 2 weeks with my brother and I will ask him some things about this and hopefully it will clear my head.	1
I got a well paying job to provide for our future, a job I travelled hundreds of miles for each week, and it was only for a few months.	1
You: ok, but wouldn't u be extremely depressed and miserabl all the time. how could u find joy in such an existence?	1
I’ve struggled with severe depression and anxiety for the past three years and it’s honestly been the most difficult thing I’ve ever dealt with. Mental illness is silently crippling. I’ve spent more nights than I can remember wracked with sobs, feeling incredibly alone, and fantasizing about suicide. I’ve spent more days than I can remember feeling hollow, being apathetic, and not caring about what happened to me.	1
I don't want to go outside, I don't want to people see me, I'm such a failure. I feel like i'm dissapointing everyone in my family. I wanted to help them, but I can't do anything. I don't know anything. I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I'm running out of time. I'm a mess. I just wish I could dissapear.Just got on anti-deppresants a couple of days ago and I just feel like something is wrong. I dont feel better or worse but i just feel weird like something is off, is this normal to feel i havent had any other major side effects exept slight nausea?isolation haven't left my house since October and it's starting to take a toll on me. I'm paranoid as fuck and i'm starting to lose it. Sometimes I can't tell the difference between dreams and reality, I took my phone apart and threw the pieces everywhere so the only contact I've had with people has been on here since then. I want to gain the confidence to take my life and I think I'm on the right track.	1
I feel sad because I have mental illness. If you don't know, that means my brain isn't normal. My brain has deficiencies and such that keep me from feeling happy, even when I should.	1
I like the complexity of the mathematics that I'm doing and the fact that I'm doing it.	1
I met my now spouse when I was 17. He had been in a two year relationship with a girl a few years his senior, which left him broken after her infidelity. And I… well I lived day to day, carrying what I could. I’ll never forgot how I coldly and factually told him with a mere two sentences what I had to endure, telling him that if he did chose me, he would be settling for a lifetime shared with a woman with severe ups and downs due to her limited mental strength. He convinced me to go for it and I wept in his arms. That was probably the first time in my life someone did not look the other way and I allowed myself to be vulnerable, instead of distant and cold. I opened myself up to him.	1
They ask if I am suicidal, as if that is the only way to tell how severe my depression is. I don't consider myself suicidal, but I no longer have a desire to continue living. Every day I wake up is another disappointment, another day of being incapable of doing anything and feeling sorry for myself. I'm pretty sure the main reason that I'm not suicidal is that I am convinced that I would fail or just wouldn't be able to go through with it and the embarrassment would be too much to handle.	1
A family member took their life last week and I’m really, really struggling.	1
Do you guys think it's ok that I don't want to goApologise and make up or move on? Sorry it’s long, but I really need advice.	0
It's probably justified that I feel this way. I don't do anything to try and feel better and I don't capitalize on advantages I have in my life to make things better. To grow as a person. I don't do that for myself let alone for other people. And yet I want to have success.. I want to have profound love. Meaning and purpose. What a joke Just wish I could hit the fast forward button on this shit and get through with it. Oh right.. There's suicide. But even that holds it's own unique stigma to it. Next to no one would recommend you do that. It's not an ideal solution. So on and so forth. But you kind of have to admit that those that do go through with it... It's as if you can't question them. You can't question their pain. Can't question their sense of guilt or anguish or depression and sadness. They solidified it and made it real moreso than practically anyone could ever do when alive.	1
I hate myself so muchWhen your only constant is not a constant anymore, even if it is it doesn't feel like one. What do you to not fall into the pit you've worked so hard to climb out of? I've had a bad home situation for a couple of years now, it's not getting any better soon. The constant I'm talking about is my boyfriend, my supportive supportive boyfriend. But recently he moved overseas and now we for talk 30 mins everyday. My friends are all attending universities while I'm here waiting for the dream I've always had. I've had suicidal thoughts when I was younger, I googled it one day and mistakenly I told my friend. She got so fucking serious. So then I told her it was all a big joke. And it eventually started to look like one. Nowadays, it's getting harder to cope up each and everyday. I can't seem to concentrate on my college apps. I'm not a suicidal person, I just need the happiness I crave. And being negative isn't helping at all. I just want to be happy again.Life can go fuck itself. I think I'm done. I'm a mechanical engineer graduate. I came from a different country to the United States to study engineering, hoping I can make something out of myself. I poured blood sweat and tears trying to get good grades and graduate proudly. I never went to parties, stayed away from drugs, focused on having good relationships with people and overall being kind wherever I could. This country does not want to hire me at all.. Wherever I send my applications I get rejects. This was my only dream and meant everything in life. All my friends and moved on getting jobs. I have an excellent profile and some really good work to show for but the leadership is a little unpredictable, so companies don't what to hire people like me.. I watched so many people cheat their way through exams and projects and gone to get hired by companies like Amazon and Google. I have not seen my family in three years. And can barely afford to eat more than one meal a day. I'm getting recurring nightmares of being a failure and this makes me want to end it all.	1
Whenever I feel like it goes up, it just crumbles down. I really don‘t know how much of this I can take.	1
Best of luck to everyone else out there currently struggling. Hopefully things start to look up for you.Feeling Broken I was molested when I was 5. I'm 27 now and I've never actually tried to deal with it. I just ignored it, but that doesn't seem to be working anymore. I feel terrified all the time. I feel dirty and used. I've started cutting just to get some relief from the pain. I don't know why I'm posting. I guess I just want to hear somebody say something nice.Aha! moment during therapy So I've been meeting with a therapist about once a week since October of 2017. It's been really great, and has helped pull me from the brink more than once.	1
New year, I'm out of luck, anxious and somber here I lie	1
Me: "You're wrong. This is UNFIXABLE."	1
So this is it - I’m stopping with the crazy eating. Should I tell my boyfriend that I’m having suicidal thoughts? If so, how? I posted here earlier asking if I should tell my therapist I’m having suicidal thoughts. I’m going to do that at our next appointment.	1
-RBZ	1
BUT i feel like an arrogant asshole writing this, i have nothing to complain about... Alot of people had the worst childhood, or had a traumatic experience... I have a family many people can only dream of? financially im good. I have the chance to try studying again.... I HAVE NO REASON TO FEEL THIS WAY AND IT MAKES ME GO INSANE. Im having alot of negative thoughts, and i cant get them out of my head. I dont see the light in the end of the tunnel. (Not stuff like suicide or self cutting btw). As i said earlier i met someone a year ago trough rs. I can always talk to him, i never met him in person but we discord at times and message each other everyday. I feel more connected to him than my IRL friends. They have no same interests, other life goals... How sad is that? Fkn someone i met online is my best friend? He is the only 1 that knows how i feel but he doesnt understand how i feel. He tries to support me, but it doesnt help. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Im not making this post so everyone feels bad for me.... Im just so sick of life... I dont know what to do... My parents have their own problems and think im over exaggerating... "Grow up son? Everyone has to get a job" "Grow up for once". But they dont know what it feel like to drag yourself trough the whole day 24/7 (atleast i hope they dont). They think im just lazy and dont want to work... I feel isolated from the world and i cant get out of it.	1

I have tried taking my own copies of keys with me in my backpack to work or where ever I go. This way I don’t have to be asking her all the time where to find X item. This was working til she lost her copy of the truck keys and had to call me to bring my copy to her one day. Since then, I only bring the key of the car that I bring with me. Well,.... didn’t take too long til that one got lost too.... I needed to use the truck and was not able to find any key anywhere. I asked her where it was and she responded with “you have hands and eyes, you find it”. I blew my top off. I yelled at her that the fact that I have to hide things for them to not get lost in the house is ridiculous!	1
It's been over a year since I've talked to him.  I don't answer his calls or reply to his texts.  When I go home to my local town, he always texts me and says he wants to come over and visit or that he wants to meet up.  He pretends that his actions didn't completely ruin our friendship.  I demand that he holds himself accountable and changes his lifestyle.  I won't respond to him until he has acknowledged how he has acted and makes an attempt to fix the problem: drinking alchohol and pretending we(closest people in his life) mean nothing to him.	0
" get off your ass, how much time have you spent like a worthless vegetable " ( no , a lot and thanks )	1
It's like I live in an abusive relationship with myself. I don't want to be this way, but I don't know what to do. I have been getting help, but it hasn't helped any. I'm just jaded, lonely, and it's getting harder to keep going on. I wish I could just go.

But in a situation where it's just strangers, trying to find their way, cross the street, lost a thing or whatever, it's easy to tell when they need help, because everything's a lot more straightforward, if that makes sense. If someone needs help, it's usually pretty obvious and they're almost always pretty receptive to help, and, provided you just look like a normal person, they don't judge. No biases or baggage over past interactions or whatever, they're just happy to have help.	1
I feel worthless and frustrated. I wish I understood how to achieve what I want in life and be happy, but I guess that's just not in the cards. I can't wait until the day I die, I'll finally get some goddamn peace and quiet. I'm so tired of feeling broken. I'm so tired of constantly being reminded that there's something wrong with me, like I'm some sort of bastard aberration of what humans are supposed to be. I've struggled with this for 12 years now. I don't know how much more I can take.Today just sucks I've been sitting at my desk at work for the past hour and a half crying on and off. Not really sure why. I feel physically sick and I just want to go home, crawl into bed, and sleep for a few days. I'm supposed to teach a class tonight, but I'm really not sure I can function around people. I know I should just cancel it, but I feel guilty doing that, and I have no idea why. It makes no sense since I can't seem to bring myself to care about anything else right now- like the fact that I've gotten almost nothing done at work today and probably won't in the remaining 3 hours. I just don't know what to do anymore.  Painfully lonely and spiraling into the worst depression I've ever been in I recently moved to a new city for a job after college. I have a few friends at work, but they're a group of guys that I don't have a lot in common with and we don't really talk outside of the occasional work conversation. They're nice and I'm happy to be friends with them, but it's hard for me to really get to know them because they do "guy stuff" on the weekends (like sitting around drinking and playing FIFA) that I'm totally not interested in/they don't bother inviting me to. Other than that, I have a few online friends that I'm growing increasingly dependent on for social interaction which is really unhealthy. I notice myself getting more paranoid with them about not responding, and I bug them way too much to the point where I know I would definitely be annoyed if I was them. Also they're not very supportive (probably the opposite) but it's not their fault -- they're just causal online friends that shouldn't have to cater to my current host of mental problems.	1
It changed my life, and probably saved it.	1
If someone has had lots of physical health issues like cancer, chronic pain, obesity etc, maybe their physical woes really ARE as bad as all that.	1
The long and short is it didn't turn out well, I mean imagine your worst situation and how low you felt. Now sink a little lower.	0
Right now I have both, which just feels fucking weird, I can't even describe that.	1
Vitamin D is best absorbed with calcium, so if you’re taking a supplement, finding foods, or sitting in the sun consider to add the calcium as well.	1
I really don't want any job. When it comes to time &amp; energy vs. money, I'm all for the money until I find out what I have to do. Then my my time &amp; energy feels more valuable.

She doesn't want to be around me.	1
I need the light and yet it hurts me...8am. Dishes done. Laundry going. Animals taken care of. Fuck you depression. At least I've accomplished a few things today... If you're reading this, set your phone down or turn the pc off, count down from 5 and get up. Do ONE thing that you know needs to be done and smile knowing you're Doing it.Looked at bank statement, saw 100 less than I expected, almost had a breakdown. Been having to eat out a lot for reasons I don't really want to get into and are really upsetting to think about. Checked my bank statement and saw that I had a hundred fewer dollars than I expected, looked at the charges, saw how much more I was eating out than I'd expected having had to, got really upset and resentful about my situation, which compounded how upset and resentful I was about "missing" the money in the first place.	1
We are not therapists, and we realize that we are not capable of solving your problems, or even comprehend your pain; but we can listen to you. We want to hear your stories, we want you to tell us whatever you’d like to say. In the end we just want you to feel heard. And of course, you will never be judged.	1
She opened up to my parents and one of close friends who is a professional who works with children a lot, isn’t a psychologist. My mom is very supportive as well as the rest of my family and we just want to help my little sister. My mom is not sure what to do, and neither am I. I suggested to look for professional help for her, as she is harming herself. However, we are not sure what to do about her surroundings. Most of her friends have depression and she is doing badly in school on top of that she is being bullied. What do you guys think? Change her of school and remove her from the toxic environment or leave her there and get her a psychologist? Been independent since 17 I have been living with my girlfriend since I was 18 and 1 year a lone. It's so discouraging to see your friends live at home, go to school, and have a chance to fail or make mistakes. I resent them almost.  I work 6 days a week and I can still bearly pay my bills. I don't get to mess up. If I fucked up I'm on the street or out of of the job. Everything is just toil toil toil, work, sleep, work. I just want a chance to be my age... I'm so tired... Drifting away from my best friend My best friend and I have known each other for well over a decade, and have gone to the same schools and last year when she went away.	0
It started because I transferred to online school and I thought it would be fine to stay up until 3 am or so, but it's gradually gotten worse and worse and as I'm typing this it's 9 am and I'm just now getting ready to sleep. I'm guessing I'll wake up at about 3 pm and actually get out of bed at 4.	1
Tell that to the legions of people who didn't make the cut and never will. Yeah, tell them they just "didn't work hard enough", "didn't want it enough" while you completely ignore how fucking lucky you got to be in the privileged position you are in.	1
I hate this.Dropping by to mention you should take some Vitamin D supplements. Of course, check with your doctor. Etc. etc.	1
I never "fall" in love anymore. I'm lucky if I can even feel love. My current boyfriend is so supportive, but as the past few years of my life, just can't fall in love.	1
It doesnt seem fair that I went through this trauma, had/have all of this mental illness, and now have to do with the repercussions of those illnesses. It doesnt seem fair that I'm suffering so much still. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of trying so fucking hard. I know this is self-pitying and 'emo' but I just don't know what to do. I have no one to talk to. I really just want to die.Escapism and depression Sorry about the self-pity rant that's inbound, needed to get this out there somehow.	1
Stranger: oh okay	1
but i can't even take my own advice. i don't listen to myself. i have depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts constantly, but it's been getting to hard to fight. i'm exhausted when i wake up. there's so much more, i can't explain.	1
I’m just taking things day by day. I feel like a depressed and anxious mess all the time but I’m trying to deal. 16, no friends, awkward, ugly, anxious, weird, constant anxiety. Give me one reason to live Can't relate or make friends with anyone my age 19 years old, just got out of highschool. Anyways, I'm a chill dude, good looking, and sociable. Anyways, I have trouble making any fucking friends with dudes my age (no trouble with girls). I'll vibe with them really well at first and play sports or whatever with a few of them. They seem pretty friendly but at the same time some of their other friends seem to kind of hate me even though they act polite when interacting with me. I can even hear them talk shit sometimes from a distance even tho there's no personal beef and most of them haven't spoken more than a sentence to me b4? however they won't directly confront me and at least be upfront. Literally even in highschool I'd have dudes try to test me and start shit with me though I didnt even know them lol fuck this shit, is every kid my age a fuck boy? I met a few chill ppl, but damn most of them seem like insecure cunts...it's just making me hate ppl more and myself more.I'm not lazy I have no energy Please stop telling me that I'm lazy and I just need to try. I try so hard but I have no energy to do the things I want. drugs are the only thing that make me feel okay i’ve done everything under the sun to try and help myself. counseling, confiding in anyone who will listen, taken all different types of medication, and the only thing that has ever made me feel okay is not being sober. idc what it is i’ll do it. i fucking hate being sober. i just want to get fucked up and lay in bed and watch shit on my laptop and i literally have no reason to be so depressed but the only thing that helps is drugs. not looking for moral support or anything i just need to vent without being looked down on and judged. thx Has anyone been depression free for 5+ years? I get better then I get much worse, it's a cycle that won't stop. I'm wondering if there any older redditors that had severe depression as a young adult, and are now completely free from it? Depression is almost certainly going to kill me, whether it's the harmful way I cope to stay alive day to day, or more directly if I by some miracle can get my hands on a gun.	1
Any help, hope or ideas would be appreciated.  Thank you.I lost my job, i'm in the worst place i have ever been, and nothing makes sense or feels fair. I have worked at the same place for nearly three years. It's an entry level retail job, but i haven't ever had anything else, so it was really the only thing that made me feel validated. Recently, for the fifth time i got passed up for a promotion, but this time marked the end. The girl who got promoted over me is one of my best friends in the world. She is absolutely amazing, and i am so happy for her, but it was the hardest to accept. She started about a year ago, and i helped train her and build her up. Fairly quickly, we became the face of the job that we did. She was my partner in everything, and i feel like i would be there for the things she couldn't do, and she would be there for the things i couldn't do. Seeing her success is the most proud i have ever been, but it's made me the most miserable. I basically found out that after busting my ass for over two years, my partner was going to be my boss. I hate that. I lost the person that was my rock in the things that i did. I don't want to work under her, i wanted to be there with her. She told me when it happened out of respect for me, and i turned in my resignation the next day. Now the only thing that made me feel validated and gave me security is gone, and i don't know what to do.	1
You: yeah, so i get temporarily happy for sure. but long term it just fades away and im back to being miserable	1
Mid October 2017 she said how we would be better off being friends since we didn't seem to be going anywhere and that it was hurting her self esteem, and that she started talking to Jake again. She is currently still dating Jake, but from what I hear from her are on the verge of another breakup.	1
My only remedy for all this pain is my girlfriend. She's there for me no matter what and understands what I go through. Recently I've been slipping a little in my grades (All B's and C's) and my parents have a very strict rule that if I don't keep good grades I'll have to leave my girlfriend. My problem is that if I leave her I'll have nothing to help me get through hard times. I'm only living for her and I'll have no point to be around otherwise.	1
Yes I know nobody liked school, but did they all make themselves believe it was school or nothing, and when they ended up at a dead and was convinced that there life was over !? Did all kids struggle with basics in school ?!	1
I'm worried about how long can I take this. Can I become numb at some point? This part it's just extremely painful and I don't think I can deal.	1
I can only really think of one close friend that I have, and even then we don’t really hang out that often. I don’t really have anyone in my life. How do you get a job after over a year of unemployment? F early 20s. I never finished college, came home, and I've been so depressed that I haven't done anything since I left school in 2016. I'm a really hard worker and I've always been liked by my bosses, but I don't feel comfortable giving references because any part time jobs I've had I kind of - just - abandoned. I would get to a point where I couldn't handle the social anxiety and depression and my job would call me to see if I wanted to come back during a break from school and I would never call back. Now I'm in this weird limbo that I don't know how to get out of because I basically don't have any credentials or references and there's a massive gap in my resume that I can't explain. Today is my birthday. I mostly spent the day alone. I got a few more “happy birthday” messages than expected so that’s nice I guess. Otherwise, it felt like a normal day, though a bit sadder because I feel like I’m expected to be happy but I’m not. From now on, I’m gonna stop hoping my next birthday will be better like I usually do. It’s just disappointing and depressing. Feeling drugged and crushing anxiety This post is not unlike the others in this sub. Today im struggling, ive been struggling for years but today its worse. The depression is so bad that i feel drugged. My head feels too heavy for my neck to carry. My anxiety is crushing my chest. How much longer will this continue? Where do i get the energy to keep going? Is it bad that I understand why people feel the need to end it? Everything is so heavy right now that I feel like I understand why people do it. I don't want to myself, I can and will fight this, but it's just so defeating at times.I’m just not fucking good enough. My parents fucking hate me, just a few hours ago they were fucking ranting about how I’m not pulling my weight and about how my grades are failing and I’m a failure by extension, my “friends” are slowly jumping ship one by one because “I’m not mentally stable” and nobody actually fucking cares. I’m ugly as hell, my face can be described as if Satan sneered his shit on the earth, I’m probably stupid, and everyone I know would be better off without me. The three people who actually fucking cared about me are fucking dead because of me	1
I really can't miss any more classes after today, this semester is really important for my grades. I feel like such a piece of shit for missing them two days in a row, this is the exact sort of thing that fucked up my grades last term.	1
It’s been a year and a couple months since we’ve talked, and there’s rarely a day where you don’t cross my mind. I’m not saying that’s healthy, because it sure as hell isn’t, but who cares anyways.	1
My depression didn’t hit until after my first child was born almost three years ago. Since then, I have been a WRECK, but have gotten much MUCH better over the course of the years. I’ve been on Celexa (60mg) for about a year which helped tremendously, but had to do away wth it once I hit my third trimester of this pregnancy (I’m currently 21 weeks).	1
I mean i really don't see a way out of this place.  What am I gonna find to "make it go away"	1
I have severe PTSD, severe depression, anxiety, severe panic/anxiety attacks, OCD, severe memory loss, and had an intense eating disorder for 6 years that I'm still struggling with constantly. I haven't gotten a good nights' sleep in years. I have constant PTSD nightmares, regular nightmares, and insomnia/constant fatigue and exhaustion. I also disassociate a lot and self harmed for years. Currently clean from self harm for about a year and a half. I've been admitted to a hospital because of all of my mental problems, and honestly wish I could go back sometimes. I was gaslighted for years to believe that my trauma was normal. My home environment was constantly hostile.	1
I feel like if I could stay in this night forever, I'll never have to wake up to reality again.I don't know what I'm doing wrong I feel like I'm doing everything I'm suppose to do to get out but I can't shake the feeling I'm just constantly on the verge of another relapse or I'm just on an uphill before another episode. I had been clinically depressed before (diagnosis and all) and tried to kill myself last year but after that I wanted to get better, to give life a chance and if it actually sucks then at 40 I'll blow my brains out. But recently since I came home from college for winter break I almost relapsed. I started to cry alot, my appetite died and the suicidal urges came full swing, I don't even know why nothing bad happened I'm doing great in school. I've tried facing my problems, I go through what I went through in my head over and over thinking of what I should have done but it still is lingering. Like I'm ready to move on with my life but its just there staring at me and I don't know how to make it leave. I don't know I don't even think I'm depressed anymore but I'm not okay yet either. I'm just in this weird middle ground of on the fence and I don't know how to get over. I spend to many days trying not to cry Being around people does not help me one bit and it's not their fault. Every time I leave the house I get so sad over everything. It's awful	1
But then there comes tomorrow, and sometimes I wish I could have stayed awake all night to avoid waking up and facing reality, but then I remember I love sleeping.	1
Im a 20 year old guy from London, England and I've been depressed for about 2 years now. I was also diagnosed with IBS about 7 or so years ago.	1
So that's just what's been on my mind lately. My new normal. What do i even do I'm just laying here, crying. I have a broken heart. I have voices in my head constantly yelling at me. I can't get her out of my head. I just want to feel okay and feel loved. All I do is try to be as nice and sweet as I can be, all I do is try to treat everyone respectfully and be as good as I can be, but all I do is get used, abused, degraded, yelled at, I fucking hate it. Someone just love me. Just make me feel wanted and okay and happy fuck How can I get my finances back to a point where I can go to school or to a point where I don’t hate my life? I guess some backstory. I’m 19 about to be 20 in September.	1
I have remind myself that they're not actually asking how I am, and that it's just a greeting and that I have to say "Ahh, y'know, just living." so they don't worry.	1
I know that in Singapore you're able to consent medically when you're 16, but I'm not sure if i can possible get around her for meds like this without her knowledge/consent. Any help for my situation would be fantastic :) Thanks everyoneI think about ending myself ten times more often than I think about sex. I can't tell if /r/nofap is helping or hurting.Desperately want to WANT TO get better Attempted suicide May 1st, wasted a week of my life in “voluntary” inpatient, was put on the one drug that has ever helped me (olanzapine, an antipsychotic) which I then promptly had an allergic reaction to, got off of, and crashed again. Was able to drag myself through some intensive outpatient group therapy for a while and then quit that too. The only good thing I have left in my life is my fiancé. I know it’s not healthy to live for another person but I’m not exactly in a position to nitpick. At this point all I can do for them is try to be as reliable as possible while also isolating myself more often than not so that they don’t have to deal with a constantly suicidal person more frequently than they can handle. But I want more? I want to be able to grow with them and be an active part of a life they enjoy? I want to repay them for all the things they do in vain to try to make me happy? But all of my options in recovery range from extremely corny (literally all talk therapy, individual and group, dbt to cbt to emdr) to actually detrimental to my health (reactions to and side effects from medications). What the fuck do I do so I don’t lose the last good thing I have?The toughest pill to swallow is that I care about the girl most I've lost all motivation for my academic life, have basically no ambition left and have just been floating around doing nothing the past few years. My parents trusted me and are probably disgusted by me right now.	1
I sat stationary, and buried my head under a recording of a person with nothing left. I held my heart, staring out at the dark that I wanted to escape in. A length that no person dared, but a low that felt necessary. I felt an unnecessary realism flow through me, as my arms folded, feeling a coldness drip down my neck.	1
I hate how I am now.Why can't I be happy for more than a few minutes? And that's on GOOD days, those rarely are a thing anymore. I just wanna be happy for more than a few minutes. Why am I not happy?Is it depression when you don't want to build memories anymore? Sometimes, I get really nostalgic. After, I feel like I don't want to get too attached to people anymore and just end up hurting in the future.So inconceivably lonely, but I have family that loves me dearly. I don't know if I have depression or not but every minute I spend on this earth, I feel crushed by this looming sense of solitude. Ugh. Fuck. Music to uplift? Okay, Reddit, I'm having a really rough 6 months. I keep thinking the fog will lift any day now but it just sits there blurring the line between myself and the things I once enjoyed. Maybe some music would help. Is there anything out there that you've listened to to help you feel happier? I guess the moody shit I've been listening to nonstop probably isn't doing me any favors. :)It's become a personality trait Depression has become part of my identity. As much as I'd like to say it doesn't define me, it really does, it controls my life enough to debilitate my every day experiences. I know we have one life and that there's nothing after that but that fact isn't motivating. In many moments like this I'm convinced that this is all life is and can be and the repetitive, short range, unchanging emotions is my proof. Feels completely pointless and childish to even vent, me writing this feels ridiculous. I don't want to exist anymore My girlfriend has left me a couple of months ago, saying she doesn't love me anymore but without explaining me why. I then tried to ask her out one last time, not to come back together, just to clarify what happened. She doesn't want to see me and when I write to her she answers back just so that I can't say she's ignoring me and she continuously provokes me to get into an argument. I really had trusted her, and she had done the same, until a couple of months ago (she's always told me I was the only person who she actually trusted, even after we split up) so I feel like I've been used and then thrown away like an object. I then realized I'm not good at all at socializing, that she was the only truly important person in my life (except for other two friends of mine, who have their own lives and whom I don't want to annoy too much with my problems) and that I will probably never know anyone else in my life. Every day I feel like I'm bothering other people and I'm not doing anything good, and probably this is the reason nobody wants to become my friend. I don't want to commit suicide, but often I find myself thinking how better it would be if I stopped existing... A rant, I guess I had to come off of my antidepressants for medical testing. I'm finally off of them and I can't take this. I didn't think they were working and I definitely wasn't where I wanted to be when I was at my maximum dose, but oh my God. I started them for anxiety mostly so I'm surprised that I'm relapsing so hard into depression. I just wish I didn't exist-- eh, better yet I wish I didn't have to participate in every day life. I don't know what to do. I used to have so much motivation to finish my college work and now I have none. I have finals that start tomorrow that I haven't studied for at all. Like, not even a little. And somehow I don't care. That's just not like me. I'm exhausted from putting so much effort in all the time. I exhausted from being stressed all the time. I don't want to keep doing this. I just want to sleep. And to think I have four more years ahead of me. I don't know what I'm going to do. I already feel like a failure. I keep thinking that maybe I could find something to take my mind off things but I have no hobbies. I don't enjoy anything any more. Not even eating, which I used to love probably too much but hey. I want to lie in my floor and watch the days pass by me. I don't want to have to keep trying. Another thing is everything and everyone irritates the living hell out of me now. The smallest thing sends me over the edge into my spiral. Three weeks ago if I spilled my coffee I would have laughed it off. It happened the other day and I cried for hours and was so angry.	1
I really like helping people, but I usually get upset when I try to help people I actually know personally, because, well, people don't always want help with more personal issues, or even with simple issues from people they know well, and trying to tell when to help or not is just really complicated. Like, I'll just real nicely try to suggest a solution to a problem, or simply offering some consolation, and instead of, I dunno, actually trying it or telling me patiently why that isn't a good idea, they just rail on me and tell me to shut up or whatever. And I just feel like, jeez, what'd I do? I'm trying to help here...	1
So, while you prepare for finals these next weeks, keep these two things in mind. You are all incredibly curious, kind, intelligent and important people. I brag all the time that I get to work with the most amazing group of students who bring unique and valuable contributions to this class everyday, and inspire me to be the best TA I can possibly be.	1
Meeting new people is also tough. It's even tougher when you're the new one. Who are these people? Do I even want to know you? Are you going to try and get to know me? Am I going to allow it?	1
Stranger: oh nice	1
Just the ritual of wrapping myself and then getting comfortable is the only thing to make me smile. I then daydream, and in that state where I'm conscious but not enough to acknowledge my problems, I fall asleep.	1
I was the only one who didn't get an invitation.I did something that made me really happy. After flunking a test, getting yelled at by a classmate. sitting alone at lunch with incredible anxiety and spilling milk on my uniform and having to go thru an hour long commute in a really hot day i get home feeling really overwhelmed with tons of homework i remember feeling very numb at the time that I just decided to turn off all the lights in my dorm and got completely naked and played my ukelele. i played my favourite song and started crying and just sang at the top of my lungs sounding like a dying whale and it lasted for like 2 hours i could feel every bit of depression and anxiety slowly leak off my body until the water bill knocked on my door.I keep filling the void with unhealthy relationships I am so frustrated with myself. In the last 3 years I feel like I've burned through so many relationships. Some I've dated for 6 months and some for only a few weeks. Everytime I get close to a guy friend they end up wanting more from me, relationship-wise. I have such a hard time saying no to people and I just try to make shit work because I get scared of losing them. It's never really the same after you've dated or tried to be more then friends.	1
(using a throwaway bc she knows my account)The divorce talk The wife and I have had a very empty and distant relationship over the last few years.  After a couple of very difficult circumstances in our lives we sought counseling several times which didn't help at all so we resigned ourselves to being basically roommates for the sake of our children.  Neither of us cheated BTW or at least I didn't.	0
My love has abandoned me.	1
Just wondering if there is anything, and I really do mean anything, on the internet that is helpful for depression.I’m glad none of my close friends know I have reddit If my friends knew how depressed I was and I how serious I am about committing suicide they would probably put me in some inpatient program. That would just make things worse tbh. The only time I feel okay is it work because I feel needed and I’m helping people.	1
However, whenever we talk it’s always about her life, and her boyfriend. She built up so much courage to dump him only to get back with him the next week. They’ve known each other for only a month and he said i love you within a week of them dating. He’s emotionally manipulative and so immature but she insists that she only tells me the bad things about him not the good things.	0
Could I prove my depression wrong?	1
Now he's talking about how if I want my mom to be here so bad, I can leave with her when she visits. And I've fully expressed how depressed I am to him and he isn't even worried in the slightest. He just keeps refering to my past as a teen who would sleep with practically anyone to try to get some sort of pleasure out of life, saying he bets I want to go back to that, that i would treat his son better if he were black, and that i would try harder to not upset my husband if he were black.	1
Hey ladies, i know you'll probably hate me for this, but I'm not gonna go. I wasn't feeling it since they announced the change of venue and now James asked me to go to Vegas. So I rather do that. I apologize for the late notice".	0
So there it is. There's one step. It might just be one step, but it's a step in the right direction. There's my holy shit moment of the day, and I just wanted to share with you all. There is hope. There is progress. There is love. And I hope you all are able to find it. Im wasting my life As a 15 year old currently, I feel like i'm entirely disconnected from every human soul on this planet. I cannot properly have social interactions with others without me overthinking stuff that person says. What I mean is, if a "friend" tells me i'm dumb jokingly, I take it at heart. I take everything too literal, I cannot properly talk to others without me being awkward and silent. I cannot talk to people if I have ignore them constantly, if someone addresses me so they can talk to me, I sometimes ignore them and pretend like I never heard them. If a person says hi to me, I stay silent. I'll never get a girlfriend, i'll never feel a girls hand, or the feeling of affection, comfort, and attention. I never even got to talk to a girl before. Seeing everyone at school socializing with their girlfriend, hugging them, doing everything for them, absolutely destroys me as a person. I can see why I got bullied. Those times I was called "Pussy" "Weak" "Retarded" turned out to be true. The physical bullying I received, when they pulled my hair and embarrassed me in front of everyone in class by flipping me off my chair. I understand now, the stuff I deserve. I can see why my dad abondoned me ever since I was born, he was never there for me, I don't know what type of man he is or how he looks like. The brothers and sisters I never met, which I dearly wish I could. They're all so young, I wish I could have been a big brother for them. I hate living in isolation and loneliness. As if I wasn't lonely enough at school, but now at home. Everyone takes their brothers and sisters for granted, but a person like me would love one of those. My grandparents and mom say they love me, which I do believe, but I still feel no more or less that same, it doesn't matter in the end. I cannot do simple activities at school that involve groups, no because a person could possibly screw it up for us, but because I need to socialize. I cannot do sports because it involves me being around people and I absolutely despise it. What am I so afraid of? Being judged? Why am I here? What am I? It doesn't matter, I still die in the end anyways. Maybe taking my own life is the answer, it resolves all the pain I have received. Who cares what my so called family feels? They must know its for my own personal benefit, they should realize that when I do eventually end myself, that I will no longer feel the pain I once received. I never have felt an emotional connection between any of my family, they're doing their own thing in their life. Nobody at school would care, I only have two friends. Ones I hold dear because they understand my pain. Looks are deceiving aren't they? A lot of people in my school consider me attractive and cute, but good does that do me? I won't get any benefit from it either way.  A bit of a description of how I look like, long hair, feminine face, a thin appearance (not super thin, I weigh about 130). But anyways, I simply plan on ending my own life sooner or later, I don't know how long I can last. We have no value, no significant purpose of existing, so might as well end it now. I constantly wear this mask where i pretend i'm happy, when i'm not.	1
Fuck. Anyone else wish they had a "real" disease? I feel really bad for wanting to have a "real" disease that will result in my dead.I don't know what to do with my life and I'm running out of time. Lately I feel like I'm expecting too much about life, I'm afraid that it will never be what i wanted it to be. I feel that my dreams will never come true. And I don't even have a dream.	1
When you feel like he’s pulling away, don’t push harder.	1
So then that leaves like two male friends, and again because they're in relationships with B and M, I'm trying to pace myself with hanging out with them so one of them don't get upset. It's also pretty hard to make friends in a school where most people are white and really attractive, or already have their place. I'm a non-attractive Asian female that tends to make weird jokes and seem really masculine with the way that I mainly put forward, and I just don't fit in anywhere. I have a lot of anxiety of what people think of me, so then I sometimes struggle with talking to people. I wouldn't say people dislike me at all, it's just that nobody would hang out with me outside of school and it's hard to find people that are willing to spend time with me.	1
At this point I don’t know what to do so I freak out. We have an argument for an hour. She’s not leaving my car and is yelling at me. We eventually decide that I should go to my sisters house to sleep.	1
It's great that I have so many fantastic friends Online, but it's horrible we all live so far away. I'm already missing them terribly, and feeling down. I know that I'm about to spiral downwards even futher after having gotten drunk for three days. It's inevitable, but I'm trying to prepare.	1
My, now fiancé, was able to stay with me for a full month this time. Now at this point I’m sure you wonder (if you are still reading), “why doesn’t he move here?,” or “why don’t you move there?” Here’s why: He was on an exchange program when I met him that the Brazilian government paid for. The requirement for that visa is that he must stay in Brazil for two years before he can legally move back into the USA. In other words, he is stuck there while I’m stuck here both separated and both in fear of him being rejected. We applied for the fiancé visa and now we are waiting for the approval. I refuse to move where he lives because of how high the crime rate is and due to Brazil’s economic status, we both agreed it would not be good for a white American target to live in a high crime area.	1
With all of that said, and here I go contradicting myself, but all of what I’ve just previously wrote scares the absolute shit out of me. I’m terrified that I’m starting to give less of a fuck. Also, while I don’t think I’ll ever truly be happy, I still have hope that I will be one day. But it’s not looking goodDoes anyone else feel like this? Do you know that feeling where you just feel... lost?  You feel trapped in a world that you didn't want to be in, forced to try and functional like a normal member of society.  You want to die, but you're so conflicted about death.  You're conflicted about everything.  You can't decide whether it'd be better to feel nothing or to let out all your emotions.  You procrastinate so much, because it all feels so worthless.  Happiness lasts a few minutes, but rarely through an entire day.  When I'm lying in my bed, I think about life, and I think about death, And neither one particularly appeals to me Nowhere Fast - The Smiths	1
I want to feel safe and happy and like I give back and help people. I dont want to waste my life. I dont know why but I keep feeling like I'm going to die soon. I dont want to but its in my head.	1
So as school was finishing up and I had exams to study for, I spent most afternoons essentially consciously unconscious as I was too tired and struggling to keep a focus on homework and related tasks. Long story short told my parents I had been taking Adderall once and a while and we talked to the psychiatrist and he was very understanding and after trying to allow the SSRI to do its magic, he ultimately added an Adderall script to my regime.	1
This makes me feel so ashamed of my depression and like I’m not reaching peoples expectations of how I should act. I don’t have the energy to hide that I’m not okay anymore...	1
I guess this must explain why I'm gawked at so much in public. Imagining what I must look like from someone elses point of view makes me feel ill.	1
How do I do it on good terms? How do I get over it and not let the grief consume me? Please help.Ideas for sleep? Hey guys, I’m not sure if I’m depressed, I’ve never been officially diagnosed. However, I feel a sense of deep sadness and fear almost constantly, but I hide it super well. The fear aspect seems to get worse at night, im not afraid of one specific thing it just turns into an overall consuming dread. I want to cry like 80% of nights but I simply can’t. I also want to sleep more than anything in the world, it’s my favourite thing. However, I can’t sleep, no matter how hard I try I normally lie awake for hours and when I do sleep I just wake up like 5-7 times a night. I only want to use sleeping pills as a very very last resort. I try to not use electronics before bed, or to watch something happy, but that feeling of being small and smothered and scared and full of dread is still there. Any ideas on how to make it better?	1

Sleeping to avoid hurting myself Sleeping seems like the only way to keep myself from self-harming. I have bipolar 2 (heavy on depression, light on mania), so my depressive episodes always pass. I just feel like sleeping is the only way to stay safe until it does.	1
When I see you, I see a hero. You survived so many years of life. Nothing has fully stopped you from living your life. You've survived this long. If you think life would be better with you being gone, then you're sadly mistaken.  Screw those people who try to bring you down.  To spite them you should live your life to the fullest.	1
cause all i see online are people complaining that your dream job isn't really what it seems and i wanted to know if life is just gonna keep getting more depressing even if you get your dream jobHow to find friends I know I probably sound extremely pathetic but I just dont know how to find friends that like the stuff I like. I live in germany, so metalheads dont just Hang out in the skate Parks, in General i rarely see them. I cant go to concerts to meet them because most of them are 18+, and I am not 18 yet. There is a concert I want to go to so bad, but cant because of that. And I am really sad because all these years I tried being friends with people completely different, and all it did was make me more depressed and feel like I was a mistake. Clubs are 18+ too. I really dont know what to do, because I just once want to feel like I belong somewhere into a group of people. I sound so lonely and desperate I apologize My family underestimate my depression and say it's just me following other depressed teens. It frustrates me that no one takes my feelings seriously. I don't want to talk to anyone, I isolate myself but deep down I just want to be normal again. I failed my SAT's and that was my only way out of my situation. I feel guilty that my mood and my sadness affects my family but I can't help it. And not being able to control it just makes it worse. I can't make connections with anyone. Everyone my age is traveling or in relationships and here I am, sad and crying myself to sleep at night. I feel hopeless and stupid. I'm 18. I should be out there living my best life but I'm just wasting away in my bed. I hate going to sleep knowing I’ll wake up in the morning. I wish it’d just end already.Ashamed of being depressed. I've never been "diagnosed" with depression but I think that I'm there.	1
Before everyone started, I asked how negative shit could be	1
tl;dr: Stretch of life events, most of which out of my control, have wreaked havoc on my emotional state. I now feel kind of hopeless. Don't know if it's just a rough patch in life, or something worse. I’m ugly and untalented I’m below average right now and will be merely average after I put myself through pain and dieting. And on top of that I have no talents. I’m not good at anything. I don’t even know what career path I’m gonna take because I’m not talented at anything. I’m not good at anything. I dont care about anything I honestly dont care about anything. i just drift through this pointless life.I want to share my experience moving to NYC from Israel - four months ago Hello everyone, I just thought it would do good for me to share my experience moving to this city among other new yorkers and maybe hearing some new voices of people who are living here and know better than me or even went through the same thing.	1
She tried to miscarry by drinking heavily for the next few weeks before coming to me about it; she had broken up with me the day after she cheated.	1
- One was when I asked him for a letter. He will always buy flowers on special occasions, which I hate. They wither and die. I just hate the sentiment, I dislike it and I have communicated this. I wanted something which lasts. A reminder. All I wanted was a letter. Years I secretly yearned for one but received flowers instead, which I still tended to. Finally… I asked for a letter. He refused and told me point blank to my face he would not. That it was silly I needed something to hold onto, and that this item would become something of an unhealthy obsession.	1
I honestly just need ONE person to talk to. Anyone. I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm not a complete weirdo or anything and I know I can have meaningful friendships (just 90% of them have been online, and now I can't even seem to make any fucking online friends either), but I live the loneliest life of anyone I've ever known or heard of. I've never been serious about suicide, but recently that's changed and it's becoming something I could actually picture myself doing. I'm a long way from that but at this point I don't see anything getting better and I practically cry myself to sleep some days and have to hide emotional breakdowns at work after eating lunch alone.	1
My friend made the decision to stop communication with me until I go to a residential psychiatric program or somewhere similar. The thing is I’ve been in one already, it was a pretty flexible place, cell phones were allowed, doors were never locked, etc. Long story short I became “too high risk” and am not allowed back. And I don’t want to go back. I don’t believe in happiness by mental health, I believe in natural happiness. I believe that all humans deserve to feel happy without being told “your life sucks so you need pills and mental health treatment to be happy.”	1
I wish someone would ask how I am and actually care about the answer.I'm going a little crazy thinking this and can't get it out of my head. EVERYTHING IS LESS THAN SKIN DEEP.	1
I can't remember anything happened to me last 4 days. Is it bad memory or nothing really happened to me?	1
I’m a diabetic 1 with Autism. For the past 3 years i have felt constant fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems, bad memory and concentration issues.	1

Please take me back to being a little girl again. Let me try again please. Will I ever feel beautiful I lost alot of weight, went from a size 20 to a size 10/12 uk size and I get told I look good.	1
* born 28 years ago. * mother : prostitute till she died , got pregnant while she was doing her clients , died when i was 17 on cancer * father : since she is a prostitute , no idea * stephdad : abused me till 13 years old. got sex with animals/children , still free on lack of evidence and there is no specific help for this “mentaly illness” and there is no space in prison … im not joking, this is how it works in my country * life : child protection agency took me away when i was 2 * lovelife : some light in my life ... knew her since i was 10 and fall in love  , started dating her at 16 till she died when i was 22 * work : putting a mask everyday.... working for food and paying rent * social : nothing but staring at a screen and masterbating	1
In a way I don’t want to deal with something this heavy again and I know that’s selfish I lost years of myself helping care for my dying father then 100% for my mom I was pushed to the brink of my own sanity	0
I know something's wrong, but I don't know what to do about it. In some ways I'm sure I'll always think this way about myself, regardless of what I do, but I wish there were an easy way to manage it.	1
I've noticed that the people I do get along with are like me. Introverted, cold, and academic. We do not see each other as people, but as enlightened books with fresh concepts. These ideas are interesting to explore. If the book is lost, we are disappointed but not crushed. We were never bound by friendship; we were tied by our interests and perhaps mutual isolation. I don't feel an ounce of human warmth from these acquaintances. I think i'm okay, but in reality and in hindsight I am completely not okay. I think I am literally dying day by day. Hello to anyone out there,	1
Needless to say I don't like who I am. Maybe you don't either. I'm not as strong, wise, caring, compassionate, friendly, hard-working, courageous, generous, et fuckin cetera that I'd like. "Well, why don't you change?"  Cause I clearly don't fuckin want to.	1
The thing is its not the first time, it happens all the time, I rarely find anyone who actually has proper chat with me (always just 'fuck now dude?' or that type of crap) so I start getting feelings and they seem to like me, we meet and it all seems to fall apart aftwerwards. Your just gonna have to trust me that im not creepy, I dont make sexual advances, I can hold convo, make people laugh, everyone always seems happy to spend a good few hours with me and not want to go home yet when they do it all comes crashing down.	1
I can't think of many reasons why I'd be this physically exhausted all the time. Literally every doctor says "You you are just massively depressed". No, I don't believe I'm depressed to the degree that it makes me physically exhausted. If I still have plenty of hope for the future, want to get up, want to get dressed, want to shower, want to look good...how is this major depression to a point where I'm also tired all the time? Is it possible to have some major depressive disorder and not be hopeless and still be motivated to work hard and try new things? Because if it is, someone needs to tell me that. Any time a doctor tells me I must be depressed if I'm so tired all the time and I tell them that I'm not hopeless or suicidal or unmotivated then they go, "Oh well I don't know what it is then".	1
I'm not going to starve and die or anything. My family has money, and has offered to help me pay bills if i can't find a job, but that just makes things worse in a way. I moved away from home because i wanted to be my own person. It has been three years and i haven't had to ask for help from anybody. I hate the thought that i will have to rely on these people who have given me everything to give me more. It isn't their fault that i'm a fuck up.	1
In the final grade of my middle school I met a girl. She was about two years younger but liked the same things I did. I was so happy to finally meet someone like me. We have bonded a lot and she was the first person I truly loved, except for my family, of course.	1
I last called my dad in mid-December for his birthday.  I wanted to see how long it would take him to actually call me.  It's been three months and I've not heard a word from him.	0
Today I started a new (third, I now have three of these stupid things) job. I thought I did pretty good considering the store didn’t burn down and no one told me that I was a failure. But literally as soon as the sun set, I feel all my doubt and darkness telling that I’m lying to myself. That I’m being naive by thinking that I did well, that I was probably a huge burden to everyone else in the store. But I’m trying, so that has to count for something right? I went and got a third job on my own, so why don’t I feel like I should be proud of myself?	1
That’s the third..	1
The summer after my sophomore year I was in the darkest place of my life. I had to pull out of university and move home to get therapy. It was actually very effective, and my junior year was a home run. I was getting the highest test scores in STEM classes with 600 students, I was killing it in my philanthropic efforts, and I had more friends and social obligations than I knew what to do with.	1
When i eat, food doesnt have any difference, it just fills void called hunger.	1
I don't want to be me anymore I don't want my life, I know that life is shit and throws stuff at you but I can't handle it, my anxiety is so bad I don't open the front door or answer phone calls even if it's my friend.	1
He can spend hours on google about a discomfort he feels and freaks out because webmd says it one thing and another site says something else. He checks his heart rate every 15 minutes because he downloaded an app on his phone.	1
Hi there, first time posting. I see a lot of posts from high school/college aged people, and being through that myself, all I want to do is reach out and hug them and tell them how special they are. Instead of writing all the typical stuff "you're so young," "you'll grow out of it," "go see a therapist/take medication," etc., I thought I'd share how depression affected me mentally &amp; emotionally and my journey through college. I got to the point where depression was life threatening, and I had given up all hope. I was lucky because my mom (and my dad) were 100% committed to my recovery, even if it meant I deeply hated and resented them at the time. I realize not everyone has that, but in sharing my story, I hope that maybe certain aspects can resonate with people going through the same thing I did and help them not feel so alone.	1
I posted a few times on this forum last year April sometine due to my depression and I'm posting again because well, it's back. So I'm just going to write a few things about myself and why I'm posting here.	1
I was so distraught that I couldn't go to the funeral. I was afraid to see his body. I hate myself for being so weak. He was 28. It shouldn't be. He should still be alive.	1
Background: I'm gay, and was raised Catholic in the 90s. Guess what happened next!	1
The thing about being an adult that spent their entire teenage years thinking they would have killed themselves by now is realizing that your mental illnesses have real repercussions. I have fucked bones and a fucked stomach because of an eating disorder that lasted so long and a GED because I couldnt find the will to do schoolwork when I was just trying to find the will to live another day and not cut myself again. I can’t afford college because I didn’t do any extracurriculars to get scholarships because the thought of having to stay after school made me want to have a panic attack and i just wanted to sleep. I have no friends because when people invited me to hang out my anxiety made me cry myself to sleep instead. I didn’t have any real thought-out “grand plans” because I was too busy hurting myself and getting high and wanting to kill myself to really sit down and plan things out. I said I wanted to do things but never took the time to think it all through.	1
Too kind, and sweet, too good to everyone you came across even though you knew there was a pretty good chance that they’d never return the favor. And man I really tried to, all those times we walked around talking about how much we wanted to die and how sad we were, but the whole thing was build on the back of our own loneliness and sadness.	1
Stranger: did u have a problem?	1
Nothing makes me happy, I don't enjoy doing anything that I can do by myself. I hate being alone, I hate my own company. I guess I just hate myself. Is this depression? Do I just suck? Maybe I'm just being dramatic.	1
My Mom shot herself. Hi forum, I am going through alot right now and have no idea what to do. I will tell you the story, its a long one.. I hope you are willing to read.	1
I can't even talk to anyone about this. Everyone just tells me to man up and work some shitty job picking fruit in the fields. No one understands that I actually have goals in life. I refuse to accept a life where I work 60 hours a week, breaking down my body, for $30k a year with no room for advancement and living in fear every day. I've never been fond of life in the first place. The only thing that ever gave me happiness was growing my net worth, and pretty soon I won't even be able to do that. Why shouldn't I end it all at that point?	1
2) I don’t have friends. Granted, that’s because my mother literally and intentionally isolated me so I have no social skills at all.	1
A hated me by that point. He began to tell people what he thought of me, and they listened. I watched helplessly as some of my closest friends and roommates began to look down upon me, if not for what A was saying then for my severely depressed behavior. I couldn't even really blame them. After camp, when we had our traditional fun awards ceremony, A was awarded "Most likely to make camp happen by himself". I was awarded "Linger", a camp song I was known for singing, but also a very pointed jab. It was humiliating. At the afterparty that night I drunkenly told A everything. He said it was ok, and I cried lying drunk on the porch.	1
I have the me that stares deep into the darkness all the time and the me that deals with and tries to make sense of the aftermath. Every time that person takes over I feel a part of me being lost. In a way it us insanely scary that depression can eventually turn into this.	1
My anxious nature is making things more challenging because now I'm thinking is it the depression or relationship issues? My anxious self might pester him for answers but I am not sure if that is helpful.	1
I try and try but in honesty I don't think there's anyone who would look out for me	1
All I want to do is to forget about her, because as the title says... this relationship is killing me.Had one of those days where I really wanted to just get out of bed and be with people: hit up my friends and no one could hang out or seemed into it. Really brought me down, man. I feel like I give a lot and don't get a whole lot in return sometimes. And part of this is probably just egocentrism. I shouldn't expect my friends to plan their day around me last minute, even though I told them I was feeling lonely. It just sucks because I feel like I would do anything for the people I care about, like I would drop anything to be there. I put those standards on other people and maybe that's wrong of me.	1
I'm sorry things ended badly. I'm sorry that for months after they spiraled out of control. I'm sorry.	1
I hate that I still give a fuck about them.I lost a friend I just graduated high school and all throughout high school I have struggled with depression and anxiety. At my school, there was this really cute girl who I had a crush on. She was in two of my classes and I got know her pretty well. Although she was kind of out of my league and I could tell she wasn't into me romantically, I never minded just being her friend because she's really sweet and mature compared to most other people at my school. It made me really happy to spend time with her and made my day so much better at school even if it was just walking in the hall for a few minutes. Most of my mental health issues came from school related things and when I was with her I would totally forget about all that stuff. Unfortunately, sometime towards the end of the school year, she started dating another guy and after that she didn't really seem interested in being my friend. Now it's summer and I've tried to keep in touch with her. I send her snapchats sometimes but she usually leaves me on open. I hate seeing pictures of them together. I want to tell her how I feel and that I wish I could be her friend still but I'm worried it will just create a bad situation. I really don't know what to do.I [18F] finally feel like i’m getting better I was diagnosed with depression about 4 years ago. Honestly every single day for the past 5 years I have debated killing myself, I tried a few times but I was unsuccessful. Really I was down in a hole, couldn’t seem to find an escape. My parents tried their best but were at a loss.	1
The depression has had a serious negative affect on my love life, at times making me cold and even cruel. The most egregious example of this was when, after having dated this girl for a few months, I stopped talking to her almost entirely and started flirting with other girls. Eventually she had to get her friend to break up with me on her behalf because I was refusing to talk to her. At the time, because of the depression, I thought little of myself, seeing myself as a worthless scumbag, and so I started acting like one. I was also afraid to open up to some else, so instead I became emotionally cold and avoidant. I hated this behavior in myself, and held a deep guilt for how I had treated women I had been with, so about 5 years ago I stopped dating entirely.	1
While the pain is temporary, This thing you're about to do - It's permanent.	1
It makes me hate myself even more thinking about all the things I could do if I could just find some motivation or will to be better.How much longer can I fake it? I'm 33, had a full-time job for several years and have a young son.  I took a leave from work in 2014 for mental illness, at which point I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, prescribed Zoloft and was back at work when my short term disability ran out.  This was the first time I'd been on anti-depressants.  I felt tired all the time, had no sex drive, and started gaining weight, but at least I was functional.	1
“The fact has not created in me A sense of obligation.”	1
Stranger: like now?	1
I wish I could stop working and just focus on school, cuz it genuinely makes me happy as long as I can dedicate the time to it. But after working I just wanna do nothing. And if I work less hours I just get stressed about paying rent.	1
After I graduated, I had the amazing opportunity to go to the BEAUTIFUL island of Taiwan, where I spent an amazing year learning Chinese (Mandarin), meeting people all around the world, experiencing a new culture for the first time, it was indeed a life changing time for me. But it wasn’t easy for my boyfriend and I. We fought in occasion, texting makes it really hard to communicate emotions, and we only had about two hours out of our days to talk due to the harsh time zone differences. The year went by quite quickly and he surprised me with yet another plane ticket to Portland where he would also land only two hours after I did and we would be together again. It was only for two weeks again but I felt complete... He even proposed on the Fourth of July. He was yanked away from me again soon after and it tore me down. My heart crumbled.	1
You feel so helpless.	1
Suddenly, I'm back down to self-doubt and I can feel depression clawing at me, it's trying to rip me apart again. But, no more. I'm pushing it back. I've confirmed EVERYTIME, that family is my main source of toxicity. FUCK THAT.	1
There's no real point to this story, but I just wanted to get this out there, because I'm really proud of the progress I've made so far.I'm afraid to be alone. People are a distraction but once they're all gone I can't help but get anxious of the idea that I am here in my room by myself with my thoughts and there is no one out there that I want to give me some closure. There is no one out there that I want because the conversations with them feel so meaningless and unhelpful. I feel aware of my mind and feel like this whole world is a distraction of some dark shit that's happening behind it all and it freaks me out and I don't know what do, I'm afraid.I believe much depression is about a lack of hope 'I don't want to die, I just want to stop existing'	1
I think what I'm most jealous of is her freedom while I'm chained to a desk job all day.	0
Then my mom calls me and eventually asks me if I am driving to my sisters house. I don’t respond to the question because I don’t want to lie, and she finds out that Icwas nearby.	1
I'm living the hardest time of my life. A 10-year "war in lifetime", as I call it, still going on, and doesn't seem to have an end soon. I know those good old times are just memories, obviously. Tomorrow when I wake up, things will be just the same. But my hope will never die. My redemption will come, soon or late. This moment of my life will also be just memories, just like those good old days of my childhood in France.	1
It all went downhill from there. I feel like I’ve lost a part of myself. My personality, my identity, whatever. I feel like when I talk to others I’m not “there”, like I’ve lost control of what I say and think. Like I’ve lost my mind. Like others are normal and I’m in my own world, going through life on automatic mode, not knowing what I should think, say, or do. Even though from outside people might say I’m completely normal, even sometimes better than before, I feel like mentally, inside, the world is going down. My life is crumbling. Like piece by piece I get further away from a solution. Things that seem to work for others don’t work for me.	1
My worries, anxiety and guilt sometimes just makes me want to scream.Opened up to a "friend" about my depression. It could've gone better. Hello, Reddit.	1
It can't possibly be true that no one understands me, so I must be actively trying to sabotaging myself by distinguishing every aspect of myself apart from everyone in every instance.	1
Edit: You know what, fuck this I'm gonna edit this. I don't think I'll get better. I don't think there is a better way of living. Anytime I am "happy" or "over it", it all comes crashing the fuck down and becomes 10x worse. I don't trust that fucking shit called "happiness". It's always a lie and always lets me down. I'd rather be depressed and suicidal because at least I know it's real. It's not some bullshit fleeting feeling that I get that leads to disappointment. Reddit comments and therapists and shit can tell me I'm mistaken, but that's all bullshit because it's all a fucking lie and the only real emotion is emptiness, fear, self loathing, and paranoia. Sorry, but for me that is it. Case closed.Depressed people get sick, too; How stigma in the medical community made me sicker I’ve often found myself in a chicken and egg situation with my doctors when it comes to depression.	1
I’ve lost a decent amount of sleep over this because the support was reciprocal, so it feels like I've lost a large part of my support network. I’m looking for any opinions on what I should do here, because I’m hurting and it’s already been a bad time (of which this person is aware). I've already asked them twice what's up and the question has been turned on me both times, as if I'm the one with the issue.	0
So, i meet this girl on the internet in my later 17's , i was an active practitioner of Karate Kyokushin, Muay Thai and Box back then, i was about to enter in the amateurs and start to compete, i even went to japan 2 times on the championship and training grounds. Then, i meet this one girl , i had just left an relationship with another girl that end up with her cheating on me and well..i was even younger than now and i knew it how to fight, so..I beat the crap out of the guy and was disgusted by woman and by fighting like that again , i was so frustrated that i was traded by a 14 old boy (geez) but i overcome that. When i meet this girl (I'd call her Kim from now on) i was clear about all that situation and that i was not up for a relationship with her or anyone else. She was earning a place in my heart because Kim seems so different from other girls and was treating me well, she respected my hobbies, my dreams (it was 5 months to 18 years and i was going to join the military because IT WAS MY DREAM) and myself as a ''man''. So, she visited me, i visited her, we were 2 states of distance of each other, but ''never too far to our love don't reach each other'' bullshit (387 Miles) and of couse we started to dating and have sex, and all the vows of love, you guys know what i'm talking..	1
That's just one example, but then I look at areas like American healthcare or the fact my family and others are wealthy while there are people fucking dying because they cannot get water or food. Even the American political system with the deep state and shit. Why are we even on this damn earth? Seriously, what is the point of everything in life? I simply don't view the joys of life being worth living for.	1
i feel like i'm too analytical and critical. everything i look at, it's fake. cheap. nothing complicated. just crap. everything just feels fake.	1
Idk, it doesn't sound like much when it's written down, but it's been a while since I've done a last minute cancellation quite that bad, and I've just been left feeling really guilty about the whole thing.I Am Going to Kill Myself When I Move Out I've thought about doing it now, but I'm not retarded. I can't do that to my parents. All of my friends have told me that they are going to college in a different state, so they might not even hear the news. One thing that bothers me the most is that I'm still a virgin. idk that makes it worse, i started drinking and shit just to get my mind off of it but yeah, ill graduate high school, move out, and end it.I love life, but having to work and waste my life makes me suicidal. I just dont understand, i tell people the way i feel and they say shit like "well you have the weekend at least" AT LEAST?! what the fuck. my life is being drained away one day at a time, i have all these hobbies and interests that make life worth it and i just dont get to enjoy them instead i just sit inside at a desk all day doing things i hate.	1
You: yes indeed. that's very true	1
I was texting H about it a bit more tonight and this is what I get in reply to how I feel about the whole situation- "i feel like there were so many expectations from others that it was made into something i thought i wanted, but then i realized it wasn’t." That attraction she had to me? It wasn't real. It was all made up because of her friends. And of course it was, because who would be into someone like me?	1
I've never posted here before. I'm a bit nervous about sharing this story (I'm very shy, even anonymously), so I want to thank you in advance for taking the time to read it. I'm hoping that just getting it off my chest will help, even if only a little. Also, I'm sorry if this post rambles on a bit or is incoherent at all, I'm not in the best state of mind at the moment.	1
I like seeing the trees trying to survive the winter, how splendorous they are. In them I see people going through hard times and the beauty that exists within them.	1
I want to actually live again I want to enjoy life not let it pass me by I want to change. Suicide is a constant thought though I dont feel a desire to do it I have people who I care about and who care about me and I know deep down that Id never consider suicide a valid option but it seems that I can't help but constantly think about it throughout the day, every day. Is this something that leads to the actual act or is it just being in a dark place? I feel so apathetic and when Im not totally numb I feel like there's this pit of sadness in my stomach that Im trying to digest. I dont think I genuinely smile or laugh anymore it's all just reflexes so my family doesnt have more to worry about. I feel like i cant tell people how I am because were all struggling so hard to stay afloat and stay strong for each other and piling more misery on seems like the wrong thing to do. Not sure if Im even looking for answers but it feels good to get it all out of my looping brainReddit isn't a nice place for someone who suffers depression. I think it's funny how sometimes we take internet so seriously. I have no idea why the rudness of some totally strange person, probably between 12-16, made me so... down.	1
I just need someone to talk to I guess. Ive been depressed and had bad anxiety before, but not to the point where it is now where I have attacks at work and even tear up sometimes. I feel like I’m going crazy.	1
I am so sick of this cyclical life. I hate being told I have to spend 1/3 of my life at a job. How does anyone get over this?I have a bad personality that appears good. My personality is a result of childhood abuse and depression. I was treated like a subordinate not worthy of shit growing up and now as an adult I'm a people pleaser to the extent of ruining my own life to help others even if they dont need it because I worry about my reputation and want people to constantly think I'm a really good person. I know that it isn't good behaviour but I don't know how to be outside of that. It feels nice to get praised for it but I really want to start accomplishing things for myself and let people handle their own business. I want to be someone. I don't even feel like a person half the time. There are too many ways to be and I don't know which one is a good fit for me. It's definitely not this. I'm not really sure what to do and I'm sure no one could really answer this for me but I really wanted to get it off my chest. Idk if anyone else is like this but it sucks. I was doing some research and found martyr syndrome and it really kicked me off my pedalstool and I feel like a piece of shit that sets too high standards and takes too much responsibility on and makes people feel bad. I thought I was just a super nice person but I'm actually an asshole victimizing myself constantly and blaming it on others.	1
I know this is a long post, however I've been afraid of sharing my experience with others. I don't want to feel afraid of ashamed of having went, so here I am with this post.	1
Inside I still burn	1
So the night after I tell them, I get a message from one of my "friends", whom I was going to room with next year. The message said, and I can quote, that they "don't feel safe around a mentally dark person" in their house. Ok, what? Even better, the convo goes on and says that my group of friends were talking... And they don't want to, in quotes again, "Associate with a mentally dark person" as a friend. Like what the fuck? It's been a week and they've lived up to it. Suddenly I'm not getting invited anywhere or anything. If I'm with my friends (I still try to hang out), I'll get heavily ignored. Like what the fuck, my depression has now gotten so much worse.	1
On weekends I’m lucky if I do anything outside of what I do immediately after work. I rarely feel compelled to do anything. If I get invited to a bar, I end up going and feeling alienated from everyone and ‘out-of-place’. Most of the time, I just feel too tired to join my friends, but I also feel a lack of motivation because I’m sure it’ll just be the same crowd—and it appears their lives keep moving while mine does not.	1
Previous Update:  We've been informed by the reddit admins that this issue has been actioned, but we're going to leave this post up for a while in case they try to sneak back in.  If you post or comment and then get a chat request or PM that appears similar to the description here, [please let us know](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression).	1
Without having FMLA (&lt;1 year as an employee), what are my other options for time to heal? My bosses don't know about my depression and I haven't sought assistance from my company's EAP.I might be feeling this way, because I demand too much from myself. I made a similar post about how it could be a sleep problem, but I have a lot of thoughts in my head, so let me share this, and comment if you think you relate.	1
I’m working hard, I found a job here. Retail but it’s a job. I’m waking up early, I’m doing noFap and I’m working out 3x a week to try to keep my depression in check.	1
And on top of that I don't even know if I want a normal life! I Often think that the only thing that separates myself from the "normal people" (in lack of a better word,) is that the "normal people" have an easier time fooling themselves, a bigger capacity for self-delucions. And if happiness can only come from convincing yourself of existential lies, I'm not sure if that (happiness) is for me...	1
He probably already knows anyway....	1
I feel strong enough to face myself, I have not felt depressed for a long time, even some mornings I feel motivated or even happy to wake up ... but I am scared because I know that hard times will be delayed or even more, I'm afraid if something big sink me again in suicidal toughts.Cried in a bathroom stall I'm not the type to post this kind of things, but I hate myself. I try my best to socialize, to be emphatic but I end up here every single time. Alone, boring and fucking depressed. Sometimes I think maybe I should be dead instead of someone else who had way better success at life than I did. I hate feeling this way and I take it out on my family when I can't control it. No matter how hard I try, socially I get nowhere, no friends, no relationships and no happiness.	1
I've had a lot of friendships go this way in the past. Speaking a little immodestly here, but when I'm not depressed, I'm funny, energetic, and interesting, and generally a fun person to be around. I've had lots of people enter my life, meet that me, like him, then after a few months meet the depressed side of me and just nope the fuck out.	1
To provide some background, I'll be turning 20 on the 15th, and last year, just 4 days after my 19th birthday, I was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder. This disorder is characterized by long lasting, essentially uninterrupted periods of depression lasting AT LEAST 2 years, and in many cases, such as with myself, far longer. To provide a rough estimate, I have been depressed somewhere around a total of 13 years of my life.	1
I’m so sorry this is so long, this is my first post, it’ll probably get removed because I️ don’t even know how to use reddit but whatever venting this out helps a bit even if no one reads it. Loneliness is just so crippling I just can't handle it myself, and there's no one I can realistically ask for help because I just need so much more help than anyone can give. And I don't have nearly enough people to spread out the burden. I just don't seem capable of finding anyone who actually wants to be a real friend to me. I just feel so incredibly sad because I feel alone and I can't do anything about it.The last 3 days felt like the first days of my life. Today feels like the beginning of the last days. I have been having depression since Senior Year. I have been fighting non stop for 5 years. I took gap years to fight depression. Until last October, I thought depression has gone cause i felt totally normal at that time. During the time, I had a lot of ups and downs. Lots of tears, lots of laugh. But i have never given up on myself	1
I know that quitting was the best decision - "sticking it out" would have been detrimental to my mental health, and I would have had no time to interview for other opportunities.  Still, at the same time, I can't help but feel like a burden to my husband.	1
I’ve lurked here but never posted. I had to reach out somehow and was not going to call or text the goddamn crisis line.	1
But it's as if reality hit me with a shovel and said "no! you can't be happy. Be sad."	1
I'm totally alone. My family and college friends live 4 hours away. I have pretty bad social anxiety and I'm terrified of every new social interaction I have. I work 9 hours and come home to my empty apartment and watch netflix to escape my own life, every day. I sometimes hear from my college friends about all of the fun they're still having together and it honestly brings me to tears that I have such a pathetic lonely life now. I've never been able to have a "normal" social life -- it takes me forever to make close friends, and then even at my best I only have a handful of good friends at a time. I don't enjoy going out every weekend or the other obvious ways of making friends, and that wouldn't work now anyway since I would NEVER go alone and I don't have a single person that I could ask to go with me.	1
I go through long periods of feeling suicidal. Currently in that period. Don't know what to do, honestly. Years of being in therapy and being prescribed pills and yet I still am nowhere near being close to healthy. Looking back, I can't even remember the last time I was genuinely happy. The periods of my sadness last longer than my periods of calm. I'm so afraid of waking up when I'm 40 and still feeling the same way I do now.	1
To the people who *used to* suffer from depression, from trauma, from anxiety, from whatever made you miserable, I'm not you.	1
How should I feel and think about this? What do you think?	1
Really not doing good right now.I just told all 100 students I teach I have depression in an email about finals week I'm an undergraduate TA at a university, in an interdisciplinary class about the brain. I absolutely love being a TA, but admittedly this quarter it has been a struggle mentally, I often feel anxious that I am doing a horrible job.	1
My mom is an asshole, to put it nicely. She's very controlling. I've called and made my own therapy appointments only to find out she cancelled them, resulting in me having to find a different therapist AND doctor twice because they wouldn't take me because of canceling so many times, and I still haven't found either, so no therapy or medication. I have next to no friends because of how she is, coupled with my inability to speak without getting anxiety.	1
I really don't want to be here anymore, if I disappeared, it wouldn't really effect any one, my mum might be upset at first but she'd quickly realise how much better her life is without me. The problem is that I'm even too lazy and stupid to kill myself, so I'm just secretly hoping that a medical issue that has been ongoing for a while (and I haven't been to the doctor's in years because I would just be wasting their time, when they could be helping someone better than me) is serious, and nature will take its cause...what's it like coming off anti-depressants? I heard that if you're on them for longer than 3 months it's really difficult. You get brain zaps and all kinds of side affects. Is this true? Can somebody with experience please let me know whats it was like for you?Hitting a rough patch-any words of encouragement or friendship would be helpful. Hey all, I’m having a really rough time-I’m confused, sad, and afraid. I’ve had anxiety and depression for years, but had some very good months until recently things have gotten very bad. My thoughts are dark and I feel trapped. I have close friends and family but I just can’t get the words out to describe how I’m feeling. I feel numb, dissociated from reality, easily fatigued, and just very sad. I don’t believe I will get better or my future is bright. I am convinced I’m destined to be unhappy and that I will not find love. I want to scream out with how awful I feel. I just want someone to understand, someone to tell me it’s going to be ok :( I just want a hug I can't remember the last time I had any real physical contact with another person.Does anyone else find masturbation numb when their depressed? Not numb physically, but just so much like a routine now that it feels numb. Kind of like "i know this isnt going to help me feel less lonely, but having an orgasm feels pretty nice for now".	1
Does anyone else have this problem? blah I'm having a hard time at work today. The hand sanitizer smell makes me want to drink. This persons mom dropped off a lunch for them, it was sweet, made me sad and miss my mom. Usually these things don't really get to me, but I woke up in a weird mood this morning. So everything seems so loud and apparent today. It kind of feels like the lights are screaming into my eyes.What’s the point in living? Obviously with the title you would think I’m sad and hate myself or am severely suicidal. In reality, there’s truth to that, but I seriously do not see a point in living. I’ve tried different things to try and discover myself like spending 1500 dollars on camera equipment thinking maybe photography is my calling only to return it the next week. I’ve bought a jeep thinking maybe overlanding or off-roading is my thing and now I’m in the process of selling it. I have 1 friend that I hang out with once a month. I have 2 real life friends that I text occasionally. I haven’t had a girlfriend in several years now.	1
I just want to cry all day. But I don’t want my kids to see my crying.	1
I used to be a teacher in Israel and pretty quickly I've found a job as a teacher that teaches Hebrew here in New York. (In Israel I used to teach History which I found much more interesting than teaching a language, but that's what I got here, so I have to live with that) A few days ago, I had a conversation with my boss, and apparently, they are pleased by my work there, and they asked me if I am willing to continue for next year which is nice to hear even though I don't like this job that much. I guess I will have to compromise.	1
Why do I feel like this? Makes the day look useless, makes my life look useless.Feel as though I’m losing myself and everything in life is pointless I’m 21 and I’ve hit a wall in my life where I feel like relationships and life in general is just pointless. I’m a slave to debt. I have no career going for me and I don’t know what career path I want to go towards. All of this has just built up inside me and I just feel like giving up. We’re expected to go to school, work, get married, have kids, work until you die. I haven’t found a passion in really anything work related and I don’t think I ever will. I’m in a relationship but I feel as though I’m being self destructive in this relationship and maybe this relationship is dying out soon, idk and idk how I would cope with that. I’m just so lost and I haven’t talked to anyone about this because I don’t have the patience and time for people making excuses for me. If someone could relate and share, that would help. Older female fighting depression Hi I’m a 54 year old female that’s recently lost 100 pounds and quit smoking. You think that would solve the depression! But if I don’t keep my mind and body busy at all times, it pops right back up to the forefront. Even when I wake up in the middle of the night just to roll over...Boom, there it is. Sadness and dread. Thanks for listening I Dont Know I would die if you guys could all go back to your original former or happy selves and stay there. I think I've been making a breakthrough lately. But i still think ive taken more L's in life than a lot of people I see or pass by. Why me? Why this? Guys why do i have go through so much pain in life? Why did I have to witness little boys get bullied, my mom getting beaten to a pulp by some drunk, why do I have to see all of this? I have to fight for my own, thats what Im just now putting into practice. I hate life, people always selling me short, girls never paying attention even though you share every aspect of humanity that you've discovered with them. Coutesy, manners, all dont mean a thing. Im sitting on the pavement, homeless, tired, grumpy, sane, hungry, warm. I hope that I stomp a few people into the ground before I die, because I hate how much shit I've eaten.Nothing. I have come to a point where I can't do anything. I just drown in my own misery and problems. I tend to overanalyze things. And that hurts my brain. I feel like a failure. That's what I wanted to say. I really want to write more, explain my feelings in full detail, I just don't have the energy. Not even for that.My best friend’s husband shot himself friday night. I’m angry. He was a manly man. All of us. All of his friends encouraged him to get help but he grew up in a world, in a house, that thought mental health professionals were quacks. He thought that taking medicine for something going on in your head was weak. This was an entirely medical problem that could have been prevented. So I’m mad. At him for leaving my best friend a 26 year old widow, at the people who raised him, at society, for telling him it’s weak to take medicine, at whatever the fuck higher power may be responsible for this stupid, senseless waste. I’m guilty for not trying to do more. I’m heartbroken that I’ll never talk to him again or hear him play his guitar or see him turn a piece of wood into something beautiful. I’m confused by the events leading up to it.	1
ALL OF THESE SYMPTOMS happened before I got pregnant a second time, and have been intensified since becoming pregnant...	1

When you feel like you want to run to him in order to silence your overwhelmingly surfacing insecurities, understand that will not make things better. Understand that they are amplified and you are only expressing coping mechanisms in order to deal with the underlying issue. The issue isn’t that he doesn’t love you but that you make yourself unloveable. Understand that when you get into that mindset and lose grasp of the clarity, someone moving mountains for you will not fill that hole of pain. The only person on the face of this Earth that can fill that hole is you. You have the capability of moving mountains on your own when you remember these things.	1
I'm starting to think that this is just what my brain defaults to when I'm sad, and that there's nothing actually wrong with us. For example this weekend I was feeling great, then on Sunday my parents had a conversation with me that really triggered me, and now I'm feeling depressed and doubting my relationship. (The conversation with my parents had nothing to do with my boyfriend.)	1
Right as I put the brass mouthpiece to my lips, I felt those wrinkly little fingers jutting into my belt loops. I tried to stop him, but my pants hit the ground before I could react.

Hope is the worst part. I'm still clinging to my failing studies, new random ass coins and this *fucking* girl. I can't even concentrate on the other two because I think of her all the time. I'm desperately trying to stay relevant to her in hopes I can catch her when she is available again and I feel like such a fucking creepy loser. All for that small chance.How does one "find/define" "themselves"? (and where to post this question?) Hello everyone, I've, like many, lost interest in pretty much everything, I only do one thing, from times to times, and I wouldn't consider it a "passion" or a "hobby". I need to stop focusing on some things in life, and reconsider who "I" am, and to do this I need to find some hobby and start making friends again, or at least start to enjoy myself.	1
I decided to be more open with the people around me about my depression. I revealed it today for the first time with one of my closest friends. It was incredibly scary for me... I haven't felt this vulnerable in a long time. My friends typically see me as a guarded person with a hard exterior, but I felt tears welling in my eyes. He was very surprised to hear, but I'm not the first person he knows with depression so it was reassuring to know he didn't think I was some sort of freak. He also commended me for taking steps in getting better and encouraged me to continue talking about it. It was a positive experience overall.	1
**"Life is a gift "** , yeah right .... Buddhism is relatable We're learning about buddhism and in buddhism you have to realize that everything is suffering. Isn't that relatable, i don't know if i even paid proper attention but damn, that's true. Life is suffering and pain.How do you talk about depression to your friends? I'm really ashamed of not necessarily the depression in and of itself but the way that I have acted with it and the way that I have (so far) failed to overcome its clutches.  This shame has led to me neglecting some relationships because I don't know how to talk about this without seeming really pathetic, which makes me feel even more guilty for neglecting friends that I actually do value, but just can't bring myself to talk to.	1
I’m an introvert with no desire to change. I have no interest in going out to bars, clubs, or anything people my age for some reason enjoy. All I want is a person to love and spend my time with and provide each other with the human contact we need. My idea of the perfect evening would be cuddling on the couch with a girl I love and watching Netflix, just enjoying the closeness, maybe some kissing. Sex is something I want but not even on my radar right now.	1
I hope it helps and I hope she'll never get in touch with me and asks what's going on.	1

I thought of running into the road, but I wouldn't want to be that selfish and traumatise some innocent driver. I thought of throwing myself off the building, but I wouldn't want my family to be burdened with that gruesome image. I hate the way I look I've pretty much always hated the way I looked. I just recently got a really bad haircut and I'm considering shaving my head. I'll be ugly no matter what so I guess hair or no hair won't really make a difference. I can't afford plastic surgery or else I would. It sucks being an ugly girl.Tried to kill myself last night took 60mgs Kpins and 30mgs Lunesta. This isn’t a story about how grateful I am i’m alive. I’m legitimately pissed i’m still here. i don’t have friends, i hate college, and my anxiety is so high I can’t leave my house without feeling judged. i just want a way out of this hell i am trapped in every day I get depressed, so I procrastinate, so I get more depressed, etc. I hate my job with a burning passion but I can't bring myself to quit or do anything else.  My job is "prestigious" and high-paying so it's the only thing that makes me look successful to family and friends, which makes it the only tiny source of self-worth I have. If I lost my job, everyone would know the useless, depressed piece of shit I really am.	1
My mother said everyone I’m close with or knows me well including my aunt, relatives all of them wants me to take care of someone either their own daughter meaning my aunts and then other cases my elder sister because they could see I have a good heart but then she ended the conversation with when you have a lover/boyfriend you’ll forget about me, about us. Which judging by past experiences her words has some truth in it.	1
I dont know exactly what I am looking for by posting this but I have really been struggling with the emotions I have been having and would appreciate some guidance and if not, some affirmation.Making friends... Literally one of the hardest things ever. If you haven't found a group in middle school, you literally have to make friends with everyone in the group. And then, entertain them and convince them you're interesting for literally a year on end.	1

So if someone starting and SSRI experiences trouble sleeping, restlessness, increased energy, increased distractibility, periods of euphoria, spends money like it's nothing, increased pressure to talk/sing/dance, increased responses to music and caffeine, starting up old hobbies, etc.,  how can they know whether it's a combination of start-up side effects of the SSRI + feeling (much) better from the SSRI (or maybe placebo / excitement from doing something about the depression) or an antidepressant-induced hypomanic episode?	1

Dont fucking quit cold turkey. I thought I could handle it but I definitely cant. I just hope this ends soon. I honestly feel like i'm losing it entirelyBeen depressed for so long that i cant remember the last time i was myself. Hey guys this is my first post here and i dont know where else to go. Ive been in a dark place for a long time but im the kind of person who channels this into humor so not even my family could tell. I just turned 20 yesterday and ive been depressed for about 2 years now. I havent opened up to anyone about it because i keep brushing it aside thinking it would pass but it just keeps getting worse. Today i realized something that made me genuinely cry, i seriously didnt remember the last time i was myself. I used to be super carefree and relaxed, i was full of energy and would answer any call to chill in seconds. I just asked my close friend when was the last time he remembers the real me and he said it was the beginning of college and im currently finishing my second year. Its been getting progressively worse in the last 6 months with a serious drop in my appetite.  I also started feeling anxiety for the first time in my life and suicidal thoughts are uncommon Ive lost about 10 pounds in 2 months because of this. My grades also took a hard hit, going from a 3.0 gpa every semester to a 1.7. I just had a talk with my mom and she told me that im being ungrateful and that i need to get my shit together (ironic considering she suffered depression for years until i pushed her to divorce my father).  Im not blaming her at all for my situation because she was raised by two hardasses so i understand why its hard for her to understand why a teen would be depressed. I know that life is worth it and it gets better but i really cant keep the darkness out of my head. Weed has kept me sane for a while but quitting recently caused it to come back full force and i really need advice on how to get back on track. Thanks in advance to whoever takes the time to read this long ass fiesta.Does anyone else straight up hate themselves? This more than anything reflects onto my own low self-worth, confidence and general view of modern day life. I really struggle seeing the positive in anything. I'm well aware this turns people away from me but even so, it's very difficult to break out of. I can't find the same lust for life that others seem to have. Everything to me basically comes down to: "Meh, what's the point." I don't like looking at myself in mirrors, by my own admission my personality is bland and empty and I can't really connect with people. I often wish for something bad to happen to me in my head. Im a mess and I need to rant. Every so often, I'll find a glimmer of hope and try my hardest to change my life. I'll start exercising and eating healthy, and pushing myself to talk to people, and I'll actually feel pretty good for a few days. Then I just stop. I'll wake up one day and and have absolutely no desire to be healthy anymore and slip right back into feeling like shit and hating myself because I can't commit to the simplest of things. This is probably the fourth time it's happened in the past year. I made some really bad choices today regarding food, which made me feel so much worse because in my eyes, my worth as a human being is directly tied to the shape of my body. Nobody could  ever convince me that it's not. This past bought of motivation, I tried to convince myself that I was going to exercise and eat right for the sake of my health, but in the back of my mind, I knew the only real reason was because I wanted to lose weight. And now here I am, completely abandoned diet and exercise and right back into the throws of depression. All I want to do anymore is lay in bed and try to fall asleep. I don't have a job (or the desire to have one) and I lost most of my friends because I never talked to them. I live with my mom who I thought I could talk to about anything, but I feel like I can't tell her about how bad it's gotten. It doesn't help that she tells me everyday that I need to get a job. I know she is right, but it makes me feel like an even bigger piece of garbage because I've never held down a job for more than 4 months. If I got a job right now, I'd probably have a breakdown and quit the first week.  I went through cosmetology school and put myself into debt just to wind up hating the field and trying to lie to myself that I didn't. I thought it was all about doing hair, but it turns out it's all about trying to get people to buy some shitty hair product. I know my outlook on the world is fucked up, but I don't know how to change myself. It's like all these negative thoughts are engraved in the back of my skull. I just feel like I'm stuck and any move I make is the wrong one.	1
It's your fault, where were you? Don't you know that dead hearts bleed too? Now it's our time to go. because depression is not for show.Id just really like to have someone to talk to I never thought i would end up posting something like this on reddit tbh. And i really do feel pathetic for doing so.	1
As is, I make stupid little Reddit posts to feel like a person. To take control of my feelings.	1
I grew up dirt poor. I remember spending a night pushing a needle through the rubber of my shoes to get the sole back on. My mom had a stroke and an aneurysm but survived. Sort of. She became a wicked, wicked creature who loved pitting me against my sibling and I never came out on top. My entire life has been from the cowering creature perspective. Life isn't experienced but something that happens to me.	1
I feel i moved so far for nothing, and now its KILLING me.	1
Later that night I get a text... she doesn't think it will work out in the long run. I ask her why and she says we both have very different plans with our future, she's still getting over another break up, etc... Well that sucks, but I understand.	1
In reality you're quietly seeking intervention	1

To be honest, she has a horrible living situation. My aunt (her mom) is awful. To my aunt, every problem can be solved by God, she's financially fucked and letting it out on my cousins, and she's extremely dismissive of my cousins feelings, needs, and emotions. It also doesn't help that my cousin is adopted, and I know she just feels detached from her own family.	1

Why why man, why in the hell I am this way.I’ve been depressed all my life and I’m just tired I️’m finding it harder and harder everyday. I’m almost 23 years old and I️ can’t even function properly. I️ feel like I️ have the mental capacity of a child sometimes because I️ don’t know how to do anything. My entire life I️ lived in fear of my parents and now that I’m out I️ just can’t function at all. I️ had to quit my job because I️ couldn’t handle being at work in my emotional state. I️ can’t handle people being vaguely negative towards me. I feel awful because now it’s just my fiancé working, but he says that it’s okay that I️ need time.. I can’t help but feel he resents me for it. I don’t even know how we’re going to pay for our wedding. I️ don’t know anything about feminine hygiene, or how to brush/style my hair. It’s just matted in knots and up in a bun, or if it looks decent enough I’ll put it in a ponytail. I️ don’t know how to keep friends because I️ was constantly grounded for everything. I️ spent most of my life alone in my room, when I️ was grounded I️ wasn’t allowed to eat dinner with the family. I️ have 2 step sisters, one half sister, and 3 half brothers. All from 3 different marriages not including my parents’ since I’m their only child. And I’m not close with any of them. I️ don’t even know all of their ages. I️ didn’t have mother figure in my life because my stepmoms were just either physically abusive or emotionally. My dad was a drunk, and just controlled every aspect of my life yelling at me if I️ didn’t want to do something or had different opinions than him “you think you’re in control of your life but you’re not. You belong to me” or make weird sexual remarks in front of his friend when I️ would have a friend over “oh you two girls are probably going to kiss and rollover on top of each other” thankfully not in front of her. But sadly our friendship didn’t really last very long. Then he convinced me to get really drunk when I️ went to go visit from college and his friend tried taking advantage of me when I️ was trying to sleep it off in my room. I️ want to get a better job than the one I️ had previously but my upkeep is awful and I️ probably wouldn’t get hired.. And I️ know I️ have to better myself but it’s just so hard I️ just don’t know where to start. I️ have no money. No friends. I️ practically have no family because I️ never want to go back. I️ dropped out of school because I️ couldn’t afford it anymore because my dad stole the money I️ saved up. But even if he didn’t I️ probably still would’ve dropped out because I️ couldn’t pick a major, I️ kept changing it, and I️ feel like a loser because I️ was supposed to graduate this year. I️ used to be really good at math and writing and now I️ can’t even remember simple math or how to use proper grammar. I️ find myself not knowing how to spell words or using the wrong ones and it just makes me feel so stupid. I️ hate it. I️ was diagnosed with BPD and I️ can’t even afford to treat it. My car stopped working, and I️ don’t even know how to use a bus. I️ hate my life. I️ hate everything. I’m just so tired of it all. I️ already went to a mental facility for a month and I️ still can’t function. I️ can’t bring myself to end it all because I️ love my fiancé more than anything. He’s been my one true friend since high school, even if we only spoke at school, he’s always been there for me. I️ can’t leave him. I️ don’t know what to do. I don’t have clear thinking. I️ hate that I’m so black and white, I’m just trying to be gray.	1
I am the definition of a loser in modern society. The last advice I got was "to kill myself at this point".	1
I almost wish I didn't have to be reminded of what normal felt like.Is it okay to be tired of pretending everything is okay to spark optimism? So I have alot going on in my life -- too much for me to want to spend five hours writing about it for this post. What's bothering me is that lately, things have been weighing down HARD. My patience is paper thin from years of abuse and I feel like in these last few months, I'm receding into myself because I don't have patience for even reasonable flaws in other people. I'm tired of being stepped on and dealing with the hand I've been dealt in life (I am CLAWING my way out of poverty ALONE, caused by a narcissistic parent kicking me out and attempting to kill me at 17 -- just made 21). I finally told my boyfriend today, not mincing any words, that I'm so fucking tired of being optimistic. That I'm tired of pretending anything is going to be fine because alot of the times I feel like it won't. "Faking it till you make it" has worked for me in the past, definitely, but being optimistic to KEEP myself from being depressing/depressed is not fucking working for me. It's idiotic. It's not that I think things are 100% pointless -- I'm working on a set of skills right now to get myself out of my minimum wage job to get a much better one.	1
Last semester I missed a lot of my classes and made everyone in school worry, managed to save the semester with good grades thanks to some amazing teachers and the new semester just started but I don't think I can do it. I stared missing class again and everything just stresses me out so much. I don't even know if this is what I want to do with my life, but I know my parents really want to see me with a degree and I don't want to disappoint them (also I'm terrified of telling them)	1
I went to my mom’s house and when I got there, there were guests staying over that I didn’t know. I have very severe social anxiety so this is not good. When I called my mom before driving to her house, she specifically said that no guests were over and it was okay to come. She lied.	1
I called her and say ''Hey, just sell your things, don't worry about it, we're gonna buy new ones baby'' Hell yea, like a fucking Alpha and she was so happy and she cried and she was all ''omg i love u so much'' Then i left all my trainings hobbies which gives me a lot of stress but i had back then a ''major reason '' for that and i was happy with her. Then Kim's past started to show up to us. A family of 5, me, my little brother, my mom and dad and now Kim. The thing is, Kim had a daughter that was with her aunts back then and she started to say she missed her, she was sad, she was feeling bad because she couldn't find a job yet (3 months had passed, it was a rough time on the Brazil enonomically speaking)but HEY, i had 2 jobs and i wouldn't give up, she was sad that i had to work so hard to : 1- Help my parents 2- "Pay" For her in the house. I was saving money too, because other than spending money with that 2  things i didn't have the time to do other things so some free time i had we would watch a movie, take some ice cream, have sex (a lot, geez) and that money that i was saving began to get bigger and bigger, till the point that i was thinking about buying some ground to maybe started to build our own house in the future when she get a job and started to help me . We would visit Kim's daughter from time to time and i start to love the girl, she was do damn smart but had a sadness in her that i could see, and one day in the house of Kim's Aunt, Her aunt came to me alone with Kim in the grocery store and started to say that i should stop my relationship with her. I was shocked by the comment, but cold as ice in the outside and just asked 'wth are u talking about ?" then she started to say that Kim had beat her daughter so damn hard that almost killed her and that's why she was not with Kim anymore and she say Kim it's fckng crazy and all type of shit and i was pissed off.	1
Edit: For example I texted a friend of mine i’ve known since elementary school if he wanted to hang out. He said sure and he would text me later. He never did. I told literally one of my best friends I’d been having a rough week and wanted to hang out. He blew me off to hang out with someone else. I really can’t handle it.Anyone else get really bad anxiety before going to work? I always get super nervous and feel like my hearts going to explode. When i’m there, it’s not that bad, but i’m always so anxious and scared before...I am Helpless I’m only 14. My brain has stopped trying. It’s like my brain can’t comprehend anything anymore. Be it science, language, history. I can’t comprehend anything. When I read about these subjects, I just feel like I’m staring at a piece of nothing. It worries me because I think my apathy in life is going into my studies. I can’t help not comprehending what I learned. I have an iq if 115 but don’t feel like it. I feel robotic when doing my work and can’t feel emotion. It’s like my logical brain died with my emotional brain. Now I’m an unemotional, unintelligent human that is comparable to a zombie. I feel like a mindless idiot now that I can’t understand story’s. I am beginning to feel that my brain has died preventing me from formulating thoughts. It feels like my friend doesn't care about me and is rubbing it in my face So the only best friend I had planned out for weeks how she was going to do something behind my back then brag about it to me and make up stuff about what happened to make me jealous. I immediately found out that she was making stuff about it up but that kinda just made it worse. It still bothers me a lot even though it happened in July and it's still making me depressed. I sort of stopped talking to her for a few weeks but then when I felt like I could I refollowed her posts on facebook and nearly every single post is like "I love my new best friend more than anyone else" not even exaggerating. I tried to ignore it but there were just constant posts like that I just can't look at anything she posts anymore because some how it makes me more depressed and lowers my self image even more though it's already at zero. Should I just completely move on? I feel like never talking to her again is my only option.  Massively depressed and looking for low-cost help Hi there,	1
....sorry for the long rant and thanks for reading if you did...	1
But he is making my life a lot harder when he doesn't acknowledge my pain.He yelled at me saying that BPD is bulshit,it's a fantasy,that depression is just a joke.	1
If my life had a thesis statement, it’d be that I have nothing to look forward to. Hardly any aspect of my life can bring me out of the apathy that I seem to be stuck in every day. I don’t find any of my classes enjoyable, and now the thought of doing it as a career is starting to give me nightmares. I have “friends” but I don’t much enjoy hanging out with them, and overall, any attempts to meet new people just seems to amount to nothing. I have no dating life, and I’m still admittedly stuck on the aforementioned ex-girlfriend (who has completely moved on) that I dated for seven months and have been broken up for the same length. All I can think about is that if she saw me today, barely able to get out of bed and go to school, I’m also certain she would feel even more justified in breaking up with me. I keep thinking about this new person she’s dating and in what ways he is likely a complete upgrade. I don’t even know what their situation is, I am just inventing scenarios in my head. I need to stop that. Fuck.	1
(My grandma and the rest of my moms family won’t talk to her because she’s cursed all of them out horribly when they tried to be there for her)	1
I'm so tired of being alone I can't bare it anymore. My depression and anxiety is slowly killing me. I'm a 23 year old male, trying to restart my adult life in college after many failed attempts at succeeding anywhere else. I work and I go to school, I see hundreds of smiling and happy faces, and I feel like I'm not even really there with them. Like a one way mirror where I see them but I'm never seen.	1
and all it leaves is a depressionHow to deal with people who can't seem to be bothered with you? Question is fairly self-explanatory.	1
I'm not sure, not sure	1
Just the other day I thought about all the opportunities i've missed out on because of my depression. Like internships, jobs, career fairs, fun events and even a potential awesome friend but all of that isn't going to happen because i am as dead as a rock.	1
I feel like I've heard "just because nothing matters doesn't mean you can't be happy" a thousand times, and while it sounds good, I can't get passed my negative view on things. I honestly wish that I thought that way, but that's not how I think.	1
The sidebar says "A supportive space for anyone struggling with depression." and yet people make fun of me, don't want to help, and call me ugly. I guess I'm that hopeless.	1
Just to mention, Root has depressions, and has already attempted suicide. So there are also moral and ethical views on everything. We don't bully him or anything like that, we ignore him.	0
Does this happen to anyone else? Anyone feel like they’ve disappointed there parents? When I was younger my parents always had high hopes and believed in me. As I got older however, I realized that I completely let my parents down. I’m a chump with a low paying job, no SO, few to little friends, and I haven’t contributed to society in a helpful way. My parents try not to show it, but I can tell I’ve failed to even come close to there expectations.Dead is better than alive imo. I wouldn’t say I feel particularly sad or depressed, as a constant state. It’s all over the place. But I think I do want to die. I choose to believe there’s nothing after we die; no afterlife, no heaven or hell, no reincarnation, or godly ascension. Just a beautiful, peaceful nothing. And it just seems so much better than being alive.	1
My question to people is what antidepressants have worked, how long have u been using them, and has ur depression improved? Should I take it for the long term? And what alternative methods have worked for you guys?Lost all motivation I recently have stopped doing one of the few things I enjoyed, art. I cannot find anymore motivation nor inspiration because of everything that has happened to me. I’ve already lost motivation to continue in general. I don’t want to live anymore.I wish I was 15 again, when nothing really mattered I'm 21 now and all I want is to be 15 again, when I didn't have any worries,  when I didn't know what depression was, when I had interests, when I didn't have existential crisis, when I didn't question every little thing about myself, I was just able to BE. Not to say everything was perfect back then, but every year it starts feeling emptier and emptier. Even though my life has technically better, I feel so empty and dead. I don't even want to know what my brain will be like in 10 years. Even though realistically my life is better off now. I still want to die. My god, I just want to dieI'll die alone Idk why I post this. I'll die alone, nobody talks to me, never had a gf and pretty sure I won't have. I'll just get ignored. Whatever.Is it unhealthy to try and solve other peoples issues instead? I find that the worse I feel, the more I try and solve other people's problems. Is this unhealthy for me? It's always other people's mental issues that I'm unable to fix but I feel like I have to try.10 years I've been managing depression and I was doing well, until last Monday. Quick back story: 38/m/Ireland. I was a competitive Powerlifter and represented my country on 2 occasions with great success. My life was lifting; setting goals, reaching targets, smashing PBs...all helped with creating a future for myself.	1
I've had love, and I lost love. Love is so powerful a feeling, its a state of being. A person always has within him to very different personalities. That's you without love and you while in love.	1
My self worth used to fluctuate between "oh, i think i am good?" to "I'm trash" intermittently but lately it's just the bad one.	1
i wish i could just get up and do what i need to do like a real adult - so many people do it, and on my best days i can even pretend to be a real adult as well. but with you here, lurking around my apartment without even helping with the vaguely overpriced rent, i can’t seem to get anything done. so if you could just, like, leave for a couple of days before i run out of clean underwear too, i would greatly appreciate it.	1
A fraud seeking attention	1
I'm so scared.	1
Things have been getting worse again recently. I'm cutting almost every night and feel down and just cant do anything. I don't even have the energy to shower most days and just stay in bed until the late afternoon. However I was hopeful for today as I was going to see a new nurse who I was hoping would be able to set up a plan to help me. I was with the child services before and had an amazing nurse who helped me greatly but as i'm 18 i'm classed as an adult so have to go to the adult services.	1
Sorry if I offended anyone. I know some people prefer to feel something, but I'm fine with being an empty shell.	1
But the general consensus is, although we can't 'fix' ourselves, we can have people around us to support us when we're at our lowest. And it makes sense that as social beings, human intimacy provides us with a safety net for when depression's hitting us the hardest.	1
"Hide the knife, he might stab our son (my stepfather)." "You're sick, go to a doctor for a checkup. You can't give up, please don't die. We pity your son. He can't survive without you. He'll burn all the money with booze. He'll be homeless and sleep on the streets."	1
If you ave any answer, that'd be great.They say forcing yourself to be social is a good thing, but does it pain anyone else to see how much your friends are progressing in life? My friends have all become successful and wealthy. They go on expensive holidays and date duper attractive people. I try to force myself to hang out with them but the constant obvious comparison is getting me really down. Today, I found out that my depression is treatment resistant I've been on 8 different antidepressants and the such. Prozac, Paxil, wellbutrin, pristiq, viibryd, seroquel, abilify, and trintellix. It feels like the past year and a half or so has been nothing but pills. I've been depressed since I was around 9 or 10, and now I know I'll probably be depressed for the rest of my life.	1
I know there are people who go much longer without finding anyone special but I really hope that doesn't happen to me. I've spent so long being someone I'm not, and now I don't know how to actually be myself anymore. I feel so depersonalized and isolated. I need someone to tell me it's ok. I have so many deep problems and I cant talk about them. I don't want sex, I want someone who can hold me and reassure me that I don't need to die to feel at peace. I just want to cuddle and talk, is that too much to ask?? I don't even care who, man woman other I dont care and still I cant fucking find anyone. I can't even find real friends. I give up, it's probably too late for me anyway. Alcohol is the only thing I have a real relationship with.Advice on dating someone with ADHD Has anyone dated someone with ADHD? I have depression and anxiety and have been going to therapy and taking antidepressants to try to overcome it. Whenever he becomes inattentive or hyper focused on something else, it makes me feel alone and unwanted. I'm trying to be understanding of what he's going through but it's hard not having negative thoughts running through my mind. Anyone else just come to accept that it’s never going to get better That this is just how it’s meant to be for you so there’s no use getting upset about it anymore? Just have to take it as it comes.Smallest actions seem like the biggest achievements Tried a face mask today after a long time. I bought those before a big task I had to pass, which I miserably failed. Just opening the packet and using it today felt, scary. But I did it. Anyone else feel this way with small tasks?I’m working on a new app/startup to help you guys. Please read this, I would really appreciate any help/feedback. Hello everyone! I’m a current sophomore in college studying Computer Science and this summer I decided to work on a new app that caters to depressed/suicidal people who are going through bad times. I want this app to connect depressed users to people who are volunteers at crisis centers or just regular people in general that are willing to devote their time to helping the users. This app will be similar to twitch where the volunteer will go live (and you can see their face) and any user can instantly connect with them. First, the user will enter their information like: what their favorite tv shows/movies/music artists are, where they’re from, and what type of gender they’d feel most comfortable talking to. All this information gathered will be used to connect the user with a volunteer that closely fits those preferences (the user can swipe through all of the options that are given to them and they can actually add these volunteers to a list that they’d like to come back to). I want it to be a one on one session where the user can decide to turn his/her camera on, or if not, just use the microphone, or if they don’t want to do either of those options, they can just use the chat box provided. I want it to be a social platform where users can connect with other users and see what they’re doing. Basically a user is becoming friends with their “streamers”/“volunteers” and other users as well. Also, these one-on-one sessions can be changed to a room where there can be 4 users to one volunteer and that way more people can connect with each other with like a “chaperone”. I wouldn’t dare dream of making any money from this app and I know I need funding from VC’s to get this thing skyrocketing. That is why I am getting all the resources I need from my school’s entrepreneurial program and they are going to connect me to the people I need to know. I hate to say it but if I need to make shareholders money, then I’ll do it, but I don’t want to make a single dime off of an idea that caters to people who are struggling through something so drastic. This may sound far fetched but my biggest dream for this app/company, is to have a box filled with goodies being mailed to users when the holidays/Valentine’s Day/ birthdays come around that include: letters/voice messages from volunteers saying “Happy Birthday!” Or “Merry Christmas!” Or “Happy Valentine’s Day!” followed by more messages that has to do with the user. This box will also include a lot more goodies that has to specifically do with the user.	1
Knowing I'll never be with her, whilst she lives out her life happy and free makes me feel down to no end. I'm so miserable, I can't even describe it.	1

The Summer is almost over and the realization that I haven’t gotten better is  bringing a dark cloud over me. I scream at night out of anger and sadness. I constantly tell myself I want to die(&lt;-Im not sure if this is breaking a rule, sorry in advanced, just tell me and I’ll remove this part), and I cry everyday.	1
I hate this stupid town and I hate my life. It feels like I'm destined for absolute failure. School puts a heavy amount of pressure on me too. I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up, that would be ideal honestly.	1
I have read every one, some several times. I have a lot to consider and learn, but thank you for helping me find some direction.	1

Why am I so self destructive?Browsing r/nostalgia was a mistake Looking through that sub just makes me cry. It reminds me of how quickly time passes, and how I feel like I never utilized my childhood years to create lasting memories. I was just a passive observer, always waiting for my happiness to arrive. It never did.I am stressed After doing a bit of research I found out that i matched the symptoms for stress. The symptoms I experience include, but are not (at all) limited to: Emotional instability (It has not taken much to get me over the edge). Distancing myself from others. Low self-esteem. Frequent headaches. Low energy. Insomnia. Irregular eating patterns. Frequent colds and infections (within the last 30 days I've gotten 4 separate infections. I've also gotten a cold despite it being 40 °C and me being outside all the time).	1
Sorry if my words are jumbled and rambled, I just needed a place to vent whilst I still can.That eternal slumber I’m tired. I’m not here to be saved. I’m nearly 40: have a career, a SO, friends &amp; family who care for me but it will never be enough to keep me around.	1
We still lived together, music helped, weed helped. I made friends. I tried to be happy, and for a little I think I really was okay. But it was so stormy, one tip of the scale and I was back to being broken.	1
We had his memorial service and funeral.. then things started to calm down. My mom and I spent time making the house spotless and reorganizing. I woke up this morning to find out that the cat I've had for 6-7 years got hit by a car. I buried him in a box outside our house and now I'm just laying here, wondering if it's going to get any worse before it gets better.Laughed today from an unexpected source Particularly rough night I’ve been having alone with my thoughts. Decided to text one of these crisis hotlines for the first time ever... no one was around to reply for an hour.	1
My therapist uses medication as a last resort, so I’m not medicated. I should be, clearly, but she’s kind of a hippie. I’m not. If the drugs will keep me from wanting to or attempting to kill myself, then give me the fucking medication.	1
- Another was when he screamed out while we had visitors: How would you like it if I told everyone you were raped? He believed I had done something utterly despicable, blame was pinned upon me by one of his siblings. In that moment something broke, the attack was 100% unwarranted. So much trust lost. When he figured out I had done nothing to him the apologies came swift and numerous.	1
can anyone relate to this or am i alone? i hate my autistic sister and mentally ill mom and i hate myself for that i feel trapped my sister is 20 years old and on the autism spectrum she’s not severe enough to where it’s obvious she just seems like a really weird awkward person, she’s in college, she has no friends, she has the most severe anxiety and depression i’ve ever seen in someone she can’t get a job and when she does she gets fired i feel like this all falls onto me, the 14 year old younger sister im so mean to her and i don’t try to be but i feel like i’m her primary care taker. my mother has severe mental illness issues and has recently harmed herself badly, she’s attempted suicide and been admitted into a mental hospital in recent years. all of her problems fall on me as well she tells me everything she sobs to me and tells me she’s a horrible mother, that she hates herself, that she’s going to blow her brains out, her and my father fight constantly and this helps nothing. i feel so mean towards both my mom and my sister but i’m so trapped by them they both confide in me and i’m just a kid i can’t help them. this is probably in the wrong sub but i didn’t know where to put it i’m sorry i just needed to tell someone i deal with this all on my own, i have no friends and i don’t want to trouble my boyfriend with my hefty issues. i just lay around and sulk all day i’m so saddened by my family i don’t know what to do i think i may be depressed i just want some help i’m so stuck. im trapped 13 years old with depression I’m 13 I’ve attempted suicide multiple times including at my old primary school I’m Turing 14 in a few days but I’m not excited I’m just always sad my life is great besides bullying and getting left out of thing I just got back from school break on school break I was fine but now I’m depressed again it’s school that makes me depressed and i don’t know what to do I don’t want therapy because I don’t want to tell my mum only my brother and some close friends know I do things to distract myself like gaming but if it’s bad it just keeps staying in my head I get really bummed and don’t want to do anything I was reading some of other people’s stories earlier everyone here is truely greatEver have that moment where your depression teases you at the worst times, then tricks you into making you think you're "fine". Not sure how to explain it. Like, you really start to feel like shit at certain points during the day, but once you are near an item or person to communicate with (e.g. A journal or counsellor) you feel "fine" (not the good fine but the nullity type of fine). I don't know how to explain this and I don't like it because I want to be able to express this shit to the few trusted sources I have left.I just drove 1000 miles cause my Gma tried to OD and is in ICU. IDK if this belongs here. Maybe it will get removed, but I feel like I need to vent somewhere. My grandma has struggled with manic depression a lot through her life. I've always seen her as this strong independent woman. She has always been my favorite family member because just how kind and loving she is toward everyone and everything.  No matter how bad life has ever gotten for me or anyone else she has always had positive words. Well I never knew it but she's a bottler and my dad told me in the 90s she snapped and try to OD roughly 20 years ago. Combination with anxiety and stress and lots of other factors. Keep in mind everyone loves this woman she has 3 granddaughters and 1 grandson and loving kids. This woman is a saint in my family. He we are 20 years later again. My family and I live in Texas, meanwhile they live in Georgia and my dads sister/ gmas daughter and her family live in Virgina. My aunt plans to move back to TX. So my grandparents were planning to move to TX since everyone on the East Coast is leaving. When it came down to sign on a Realtor she snapped I guess again.... These are people in there 70s trying to uproot their life again and move across country. She tried to OD on some pills and my dad, sister, and I hopped in the car yesterday and drove from Tx to Ga. My Gpa said he noticed she was eating less but didn't see the signs. Now we surprised her and didn't tell her we were coming. Amongst other family all were happy to see us. My Gma I could tell wasn't the rock solid woman I always known her to be. It made me realize that you can be 70yo and still have these dark thoughts and try. She looked so weak and frail. So here I am in a different time zone trying to support my gma the best I can. My sister doesn't even know, she just thinks she's 'sick'. This woman has all the love in the world and that still doesn't help dark thoughts. IDK how I feel, I don't know how I'm coping. It hasn't hit me yet I think... Also my Gpa literally would not survive without her. Like she's the one that makes sure bills are paid on time and basically runs the house. She's his guide and he'd be lost and a wreck without her. Hes so shaken up and worried. On top of everything my girlfriend just tried the same thing but a different method and her brother called the cops and she got 5150'd and I've talked her once in 3 days. When she called I had just learned about my gma and I feel like she didn't get the support she needed from me. It breaks my soul to think that this loving amazing person would want it to go all away and leave all of us behind. I have so many cherished memories of my grandparents. Sometimes I feel like I can get these stints of depression and I know it runs in the family. So here's me unbottling to you guys in hopes to here thoughts, prayers, and reddit love.Love is what makes the ride worthwhile Without love, why suffer through anything at all? For what gain?	1
I’ve been able to stop doing those. But now... I just want to be a sloth. I want to sit on the couch and watch TV all day. All motivation I had prior to last week has just gone.	1
According to the mental health nurse i'm not depressed So since october 2016 i've been (or at least thought I had) been depressed. I dropped out of school, started self harming and was put in hospital twice among other things. I spent nearly the whole of 2017 at home doing nothing because I simply couldn't. I got a full time job in september but I hated it and it made me worse and I had to quit after I started self harming again and have been cutting up until now (i'm 18 by the way if that's important).	1
I really want to have a conversation with my dad that doesn’t involve the phrase “well get over it”. ‘Hey dad, I’m full of regret and turmoil’ ‘ugh just get over it’ well excuse me sir for being by the reality that I just pulled a mulan and cut all my hair off so that I could get another job. I went from having shoulder length hair that made me feel good about myself to hair that’s half an inch long and highlights everything about my face that gives me horrible anxiety. Maybe I’m really hurting because I went in to work yesterday and two of my managers greeted me with ‘ew gross, what happened to your hair?’ And now I feel like I’m as ugly as I think I am.	1

I have no reason to feel this way. On the outside, things are fine. Good even. I don’t dare tell my friends so they don’t worry about me. But sometimes I don’t know what to do. Officially not depressed I have been discharged by my counselor as I am officially not depressed. My suicidal desires are to do with my shit life, not depression. That's a relief then!I'm not afraid of dying alone. Im afraid of living alone. Does anyone know who wrote this. It is not be word for word.	1
EDIT:  If you need an indication of  how the intelligence of this person rates compares to their energy level, they're tried TWICE to spam their blog to *ME* in response to this post!  Why is it so hard to just be empathetic? Today, I failed miserably at baking a key lime pie. Filling was way too loose, meringue wouldn't whip, crust cracked, just a terrible time overall. And then my mom comes over and instead of comforting me or something a normal human being would do, says "Better luck next time," with the tone of a carny trying to get a six year old away from his ring toss booth. I got even more upset, and that seemed to genuinely confuse her.	1
I have a history of depression, I’m currently in therapy and on medication. I feel like my family is wrapping me in cotton wool.	1
Everyone laughed	1
**TLDR** friend and i need to look for a house with other ppl for next year, she’s making me do ALL the work, is demanding and wants some boys to live with us. Only girls have been seriously enquiring... how do i tell mate ?should i be upset with my best friend? My best friend of over 10 years recently took her first trip to New York City. I was so excited for her, and she had asked about what my favorite things to do when I was there were. I knew that she would love the view from the empire state building and decided to buy her a ticket up as a christmas gift. When I gave her the gift, she was really excited but as her trip has come and gone it is apparent that she didn't go despite texting me multiple times on the trip saying how excited she was and mentioning vague plans for when she might go up. I know she arrived with little to no real plans for the entire week and spent a lot of time wandering, which is why I feel that letting the gift go to waste is kind of disrespectful. I also feel that if she were upfront and let me know that she didn't go would be much better than trying to ignore that it happened. I want to know what other people's thoughts on this are before I talk to her, and also maybe how to approach her about it because this is something that is uncharacteristic of her and kind of hurtful to me. Best friend drifting away? I've debated whether to post this or not for ages. My best friend is like my sister and has been there for me through really hard times, and I've been there for her. We're similar in so many ways, run a small blog together and I love her to bits. On new years eve she was set up with a guy and they've been dating ever since. Since their first date, we hardly talk. She doesn't even want to talk about him much, and when she does she talks about quitting her job for him, and that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. They go out drinking a lot, almost every night, it seems like he spoils her and she's told me she's really happy. But at the same time her anxiety is still bad. She's lost her ambition to travel, adventure and take up new hobbies. She doesn't contribute to the blog anymore but says she still wants to carry it on (our domain doesn't expire until July). I feel like I've lost my best friend, but I'm mostly scared that she's already lost herself because of a guy and I just don't know what to do. I've stopped chasing her for plans because she's always busy now (we used to meet up weekly), and stopped messaging because there won't be a reply. She checks up on me every now and then and I haven't been doing well at all, but I don't want the few times we talk to be negative and depressing. I just feel so clueless right now and I miss her. Any advice? What can I do so my friends don’t constantly put me down. So lately I’ve been talking to more people and what not but I feel like I can’t confide in anyone. So there’s that, on top of it, this past week someone I’d consider a close friend was having problems with this guy she’s kinda friends with and something happened and she blocked him and I pestered her about it because I wanted to see if I could help and she got mad at me and stormed off. Everyone else with us started ganging up on me saying stuff like “This is why nobody likes you” and then my other friend comes over and tells them to keep me in the room (Theater stuff). Now everyone seems fine with me but it really upset me and I don’t know what I can do to change it. They said I ask the wrong questions and I feel like I just want to be included. I’m sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit or if I’m caught in the moment but I’ve had a day to think and it still is bugging me. Family troubles So me and my husbands parents and sister had a falling out two years ago about 3 months ago was the first time we saw each other at a Xmas gathering and while the falling out was happening my husbands sister fell pregnant with their first child and she is due in two months but they aren’t referring to me as Aunty but the will say uncle to my husband and I’m finding this a bit hurtful as technically I am the child’s Aunty and did nothing wrong to his family oh and I refer to his sister as Aunty to my kids and they are my kids god mother before the falling out happened. What should I do? What's the deal with my husband's future best friends wife? Hi everyone, I am having a problem and I'm not sure what to do about it. I am led to believe that my future husband's (married next month) best friend's wife dislikes me, but I'm getting mixed signals. I have always (I thought) been nice to her.	0
And from the day that we met.	1
Now, I'm stuck with them for at least the next 3 months. I've been back from boot camp since late September. They want me to show them my bank account once a week. They have an amount of my own money that I earn that I can spend every week. I want to leave, but my credit is crap and it won't allow me to get my own place just yet as most places do a credit check. I'm getting my own car here shortly.	1
I really think that it's time that I start anti depressants because I reckon it would help me tons. The problem is, I don't want my mum to know because the last time I opened up about being slightly suicidal and very depressed, she freaked out on me (don't need to get into details.) She has had a history with it herself and I know that if i ever took my life, it would permanently ruin her.	1
I am 32 years old, I was very close to my mother.. We had a bond that was as strong as steel. My dad whom she was with since the age of 15 left her 11 years ago for another woman and found happiness. She had never been with any other man. I have an older sister that is 42 and we had different relationships. My mother was angry and could never get over my dad, year after year we would hear how much she hated him but still loved him, she would wish they could be one again. It never happened, she had been with no one and remained lonley for 11 years. Her depression became her life, it was so bad we would stop talking to her because all she would talk about is killing herself and how she hated my dad. 10 years of it, She had little money and was very sick, She went from healthy to brittle in a matter of 10 years. Back surgery's, aching bones, depression, pain pain and more pain. It became up to me and my sister to take care of her, she couldn't drive so we always had to drive over to take her to the dr, groceries or to get things she needed, it became stressfull and we would somtimes bicker over it..even after the divorce my dad helped when he wanted to or could. She started thinking she was a burden.. then started lashing out on us at times, I went a whole year not speaking to her until she called me to apologize for her horrible words with me. I forgave her and we began a relationship again...this time it was amazing again, we got along and finally after 10 years she accepted my partner. Long story short drama hit the fan again in early Nov this year. Things were said between her and my sister and they got me involved, I got upset with my mom and she was so hurt and thought that I thought she was a liar. My sister told me she said something about my son that she claimed she didn't. I didn't care after a while, I had plans with her on the day before thanksgiving to go see her.. on the 19th of NOV. She asked on the 19th if i could come hook up her VCR so she could watch A Christmas Story, I told her next weekend, then she later that night got upset again, she texted all of us the usual suicide talk. I had told her the day before that I didn't want anymore drama, if i went over with my family I didn't want to hear about my dad and sister. I just wanted to have a good time. She then texted me and a lot of other family that she loved me. that it wasn't my fault, she bought the gun... (I took her to get that gun for protection so I always told her if she did that I would feel to blame) She would say " SON I bought it! Dont feel to blame" I hated that! Still I never belived she would do it.. I was so bitter about her not wanting to be possitive I hadent called her. I ignored her suicide text and just decided to let her cool off.. 20th, 21st-29th we hadnt spoken.. I had a bad feeling but didnt know why.. she hadnt called.. so i figured she was angry with me.. I get a call from my aunt on my dads side who she was very close with.. "Is it true? The rumors about your mom?" I was picking up my kids from school.. I said "huh? what she say about me this time hahaha?" "Call your sister" she said.. I called and she told me to go home right away.. Then she said when getting home " Mom... mom... *cries*... Moms dead.. she killed herself" I said "dont say that" about 12 times breaking down more and more each time I repeated it.. I fell apart crying for who know how long... day one was hard, day two was harder, day 3 was numb and empty and I couldn't cry or sleep, day 4 I then hit a new horrible moment.. I found out she had been in her apartment dead since the 20th.. the complex lied and said no one heard anything and thats another story.. they are being sued soon.. her body was in there so long that we will not have an open casket this week in her funeral.. Then i went into her apartment to start gathering her things.. i smelled the death and decay.. I have never felt so sick and horrified in my life. I will never forget it.. i went to where she did it and saw the carpet cut out and her bed gone.. her place was left just like I last saw it.. it killed me.. I am now on day 6 and her ceremony is tomorrow in her home town.. Idk what to think or feel anymore.. my wife is trying to support me cause her mom died when she was 17 but i am changing.. She can see it, I dont want to run my company, I dont sleep, I have this numb feeling.. I cry out of no where.. I can not stop picturing her lifeless body, I cant stop thinking "was she in pain?" picturing her bleed out her exit wound for over a week.. I cry and can not stop.. I feel like dying.. I feel so empty and full of rage.. I wounder why she left me here..  I wish I could of took it back, I feel its my fault I should have went over or called.. My phone had got disconnected on the 19th but I had a home phone, she said "I wish you could talk to me on the phone I love you"... I hate myself so much I hate myself!! I just can only think how I could have saved her.. I miss my mom.. I miss her so much! I dont feel I can cope.. Im sorry for your loss... im so sorry... welp.. shes in a better place.. STFU!!! Im so angry.. I wish I was a better person I wish I would of took her serious .. I can only listen to her voice mails ranting and raving how much she loves me.. I can read her text after all the times we hung out and had fun... I got my mom back after a year of not talking for only 2 and a half months... 2 and a half months of my mom loving my partner, getting along with me and having positive moments.. I regret everything.. please help me..I've fallen back into a depression and missed a week worth of school, now I'm behind and my parents haven't even cared to ask me about it. Zoloft made me fly off the handle I have episodes of clinical depression that last a few weeks alternating with episodes of being euphoric, having so much energy, and thinking I am the greatest person in the world and I have superpowers. It’s awesome but has issues of its own because I tend to make poor choices, act conceited/rude without realizing it, and sometimes get angry.	1
I got the greenlight to publish a book, and she offered to typeset because she had InDesign. Okay, are you sure? Yes. You're sure? Yes. Okay, cool, thanks, that's awesome, I don't have to do it myself cause I don't have the program or know how to use it. I give her a deadline for October and pay her.	0
I’m gonna schedule a doctor’s appointment today to get a blood panel done to see if anything’s happening there. I might look into SAD because depression always seems to historically hit me around this time (although this time last year was the happiest I’ve ever been, so I’m not exactly sure). I already see a therapist weekly but I might look for a new one because I’m not sure if we’re making any progress. I’m gonna try to get back into meditation if I can find any time.	1
This last college semester was horrible on me, and I came out of it with depression and depression meds. I'm 19M in college right now. I thought it was pretty obvious, but I wanted to tell my friends about why I've been talking less and have been hermitting myself out a little. So the next time we're all together, I tell them that I have depression and that's why I'm taking meds and that's why I've gotten so quiet, ect. And... Barely any response. Basically just some "oh, ok..." Like really? But it get's better.	1
I know I have talked a lot about my fiancé but here is also what is going on on my hands as well that I just was not ready for. Before I moved to Portland, I had to go to urgent care because I had no primary doctor and no money, only Medicaid, which they took. I went three times for small bumps on my hands that turned out to be stressed induced and all three times I went the doctors said “I have no idea! Try using lotions and see what happens!” Nodded their heads and left. Very pointless but when I got the bill I was shocked and confused. I thought my Medicaid had covered it, which it did not because while I was out of country my Medicaid had expired and no one told me about it, therefore I was left with a $600 bill. I heard it off for a while because I had other things to deal with than the bullshit that the hospital was giving me about it. Around this time as well, I moved in with my best friend due to a dispute I had with my parents, which really crumbled me, but they still don’t know how upset I am about it.	1
I feel as if I'm living on borrowed time, because I feel like I could, at any moment, lose what little will to live I have left.	1
I've dropped out of 4 different colleges and have quit every job I have ever had, most of them with literally no notice. I have seen doctors, I've been on different medications with no noticeable effects. I am see a doctor now, but am hoping to get in to see a psychiatrist or mental health specialist soon, but that could be a month or two away at this point.	1

tl;dr: Husband plays games:: stops communicating with me :: Realized hes my only true friend.I feel like I'm a terrible person for being sad My life is going fine: I have solid grades, I hardly have to study, and I'm financially stable. However, even though everything is going great I'm still sad every day, and spend a lot of time thinking about how to kill myself. No one notices that I'm sad, and everyone thinks I must be really happy about how everything is going, and it just makes me feel worse that I can't be happy even when I have everything: every victory is hollow and ever action feels pointless.	1
Fast forward to today, I'm currently a struggling undergrad students coping with depression and stress and well as deteriorating health due to extreme fatigue. Bad grades and crippling financial debt are the least of my concerns. Many days I would feel tired and unmotivated to do anything... and barely making it to lectures only to zone off. At days I would think of suicide as well. There was nobody I could turn to that I felt I could relate to or even understand me...	1
So basically, I'm 28 years old and moved to NYC four months ago with my wife. My wife is doing her Ph.D. at Columbia University, and I just joined her (with a work permit during our stay here), and we are going to be here for at least 3.5 years, but we could choose to stay for five years if we wish to. (At the moment I don't see it happening)	1
ThanksHousemate/friend won’t come out of her bedroom and is pregnant So my boyfriend and I moved in with our friend and her bf. We all had this idea of living together, hanging out, have dinner get togethers with our other friends &amp; board game nights etc.. it was all great and exciting but then at day 1 after the move, our friend and her bf just kept to themselves, in their room and hardly hangs out with us. Issues came up with them not helping out with the household chores and when my bf and I brought it up, they got defensive. Then our friend informed us that she is pregnant which changes the dynamics in the house even more as they now plan to get out of our shared lease early. That leaves us to figure out how to pay for the remaining months and look for a replacement. That’s fine, it’s their decision to have the baby. But then immediately after that announcement  my friend just literally stopped talking to us, she won’t leave her room, and she would have her bf bring food to her room. In a rare occasion that she comes home while we’re in the living room , she doesn’t say hi or talk to us. I am really confused and hurt because I feel like I’ve lost a friend that I used to know. Now, it’s been a few months since I talked to her. She’s there in the other room behind a wall and it hurts that this is how we have to live. I honestly don’t know what to do.	0
I mean,Suicide is bullshit ffs and yet I keep coming back to it when I lose hope.	1

I am really bad at remembering to take my meds, and usually the day or two where I forget doesn't have this effect on me, but for the pile of emotional shit dealt to me the last week or so, apparently it did. I haven't felt suicidal in years and I just need someone to understand where I'm coming from. I don't know what to do anymore. I've been with my boyfriend for almost 10 years, since we were 16. Things have generally been awesome, but the past couple of years has just consisted of a giant blow-out argument once every few weeks, generally stupid shit (me complaining of not spending enough time together, him not contributing to chores, him complaining of not enough sex) I don't know how to talk to him about our problems without him getting angry and breaking objects and me getting insanely sad and just not being able to communicate as my brain just goes "YOU'RE USELESS! WHY HASNT HE LEFT YOU YET, USELESS FUCKING CUNT". I just need someone to talk to or something. i dunnoOnce again I took the strength and tried to apply to a job and the boss asked my parents(he know them) on phone why i'm acting the way i'm acting and *Is he retarded?* He does not know what my problems are cuz he would not need me if he would know it.You are all such beautiful people. Flood my inbox with your life experiences. Your random daily thoughts. The things you want to say but hold inside. Your favorite song at the moment. Your favorite song from when you were a kid. What you used to do. What you struggle with. A meme that made you chuckle. Anything.	1
Over the course of the last couple of weeks, I feel as if I’ve gone emotionally offline. I feel like a shell of myself. I’m not sure what happened. I think the real downturn started when I was walking on campus two weeks ago and saw my ex-girlfriend of a few months with her new boyfriend, but that’s definitely not the only thing that is bothering me. It might have been a death-by-a-thousand-cuts situation because if I take an itinerary of what’s going on in my life, there isn’t much there.	1
Now we're 2000km apart and, Emotionally, I'm  struggling to keep my head up. Financially, I know He's struggling too. Everyone keeps teling me I shouldn't care about him, but that just makes me hate myself more, that I do.	1
Because everything makes up a meltdown,	1
It makes me feel so alone, what do you guys think?	1
- The latest strike was after I endured a panic attack while I was on my own, which I managed myself before he returned home. He was upset when I confided in him and he stated: I will not be on your side if you are mentally ill. I will choose our children and make sure they grow up with stability. (Later he corrected himself and stated that if I was to turn schizophrenic or manic, he would have me committed and divorce me, but would support me through depression and anxiety).	1
* I write this post 7,000 kilometres from my home country, in Japan, where I aim to live for the next couple of years. * ‎I've ghosted those whom I use to call my close friends. * I left all social media in order to avoid contacting people that I knew, and because looking at how happy other people were brought me down. * ‎I changed my image drastically over the past year as an outward expression of the fact that I'm trying to change as a person.	1
I feel like I know who I am when I'm well and I'm never awake at 5 am or failing a piece of work etc. But do I allow myself to trap myself longer by not trying harder? Letting it be an excuse? I've no way to tell really. I think I've been depressed so long now that I can't even remember what normal is. Or tell if my changes in character are related to being unwell or to me changing.	1
I get it, it's helpful for a lot of people but telling me to go get my yoga pants on and be at one with nature will not cure a thing and by repeating that useless mantra you're making me worse.	1
What is wrong with me? Why can't I do things normal people do? Is there any point in existing when you always feel miserable? This is the most awkward thing I've done in awhile, Time to take a nap and forget I posted here.	1
How to quit chatting with my imaginary friends so I'm less lonely and depressed? About to end it all, change my mind In about an hour I'll be home alone for a while so that's when I'm planning to do it. Not my first attempt, but more preparation has gone into this than before. I've got the noose ready and I know where I'm putting it up.	1
**How Depression Affected Me**\- trigger warning	1
Why am I such a fucking mess? Why can’t I just be fucking normal? I’m so ashamed. I hope a drunk driver just fucking demolishes me when I drive to work tomorrow. I can’t do this anymore.	1
Fuck you, royally, teacher.My latest addiction for pain relief Cannabis and prescriptions weren't doing enough so I added gay sex with men to my regiment. I'm not even attracted to men. I just enjoy being sought after like a prize, and the way that these guys appreciate my body when I'm with them. Usually I just get massaged/played with for an hour and then give a bj in return. Feels amazing to have another human be all over me even though I can't ejaculate.	1
I feel stupid, Ive struggled with depression my whole life and it was one thing when I was a kid growing up in an abusive and dysfunctional family but Ive been an adult for almost a decade now and ill I've done is fuck myself over by being a stupid coward. Life is not fun. Is that same for everyone? Life is not fun. It’s been like this so long that I don’t remember when it was fun. I don’t think it was ever fun. I’m not even sure if I’m in depression although I was diagnosed so. They don’t know anything about me to diagnose right? Is it same for everybody, If that is so, why people let this world to be continued? I don’t know why. I’m really asking why. What's happening? I just felt the weirdest mix of emotions. I was normal, but then I started tearing up and breathing really hard. I began to cry but I was smiling. My body went numb and I held my hands up to my face. I continued to cry and laugh at the same time. I pulled at my hair. It's over now. I still feel numb.Am I the only one when in social situations even around friends I just want to go home? I feel like it’s a horrible circle to get stuck in because every single time I’m home I’m depressed and want to be out but when I’m with friends I just want to go back home. Crashing In Sorry this is long.	1
Anxiety makes me feel like I'm having a heart attack, like I'm going crazy, I sweat, I shake, it feels literally like torture.	1
But thinking about the guy she who will eventually be her first boyfriend, or her husband whom she may have kids with, that future where another guy becomes the guy she sings with, dances with, goes to church with, does romantic stuff with just pains me to think about.	1
No jobs responded. Including the Walmart a mile away with a fucking hiring sign out front that I repeatedly went in to try and talk and build rapport with the managers.	1
We planned to end our relationship and continue as friends, but just couldn’t bear to at the departure gates. We decided to try a long distance relationship, but after a week, he’s had enough of me. He has his own problems, and we live 20 hours apart with a 12h time difference, so I don’t blame him at all. I do however carry a lot of resentment for myself for being so down in the past week and pushing him.	1
I'm usually a positive person (at least I try to be). Grew up with this girl in the church. We were the best of friends. In high school, we went to homecoming and senior ball together. I asked her out 3 times, once in middle school, once in freshman year, and once in senior year, all three times given the response "I'm sorry, I don't like you in that way."	1
I just want to feel important to someone. Or at least okay enough with myself that I don't need the validation of a relationship to feel valuable.  Why am I like this? Every time I try to step out of my comfort zone and try to be more outgoing/"normal" so people will think a little better of me perhaps, I just completely fuck everything up. I don't even feel like leaving my bed anymore.	1
About two years ago we started to get distant. She kept talking to me about things I was uncomfortable with, but whenever I tried to talk about something that bothered me, she told me she was busy and didn't hear me out. It escalated in June of 2016.	1

I know it's just a glorified hook up app for the most part but the other night I matched with a really cute girl who was way out of my league and we started talking, one thing leads to another and next thing I know we're up to after 2am talking about Pokémon of all things. I feel like there's a connection there so i ask her out and she says yes. It took alot to do this and it honestly made my month as the last few have been pretty meh.	1
Part of me hopes something goes REALLY wrong in the birthing process and that I will die or be put in a coma from it. I've never felt so useless, stranded, and alone in my entire life. 19 and never had a relationshp Boys show me attention, but I always deny them and I don't know why. I have never done anything with a guy even though there have been so many opportunities presented to me, but I always say no. I want a boyfriend, I want to have sex. All my friends are in relationships. I think there is something wrong with me because I keep saying no to the things I want. I feel lonely. My depression is so strong that I can’t even enjoy music! Music has been my favorite pass time for a year or so. It really helps with my depression and anxiety. Sadly, I’m in such a deep depressive episode that I can’t enjoy it, it feels more like background music, I just can’t enjoy it.	1
It's hard feeling to describe. Dazed or aloof maybe? If I do feel any emotional intensity, it's anger or irritability.	1
Are there any youtubers that vlog about their mental illnesses? I'm currently watching Domikazee R. And Maya Imani-Amani.I let out a belly laugh when I thought about the future. I couldn’t plan the next 3 months, then realized how much of a depressed piece of shit I am that I laughed at myself for thinking I deserve a future. I’m so pathetic.	1
So it gets to nearly 11 he starts yawning talking about being up for work, fair enough weve been out 4 hours so I drop him home, says text me when you get back so I do and sure enough the generic one word 'haha' responses start and that was it.	1
That, for me, was a lot to process. I'm not worried about myself, but the idea that I could still be losing relatives to this disease for years sucks. It's hard enough seeing it happen twice.	1

Is that wrong? I dunno. This week has been very bad for me.I’m losing the girl I’ve been with for 7 years and it’s because of my drug use, really bummed I’ve been with this girl since 9th grade I’m now 23 and I can honestly say I love her with my whole heart. I’ve been abusing drugs of all variety since I was 15, herion, meth, pills, uppers, downers, alcohol, marijuana, research chemicals, it doesn’t matter, but I prefer if it fits into a syringe. I have been to rehab 9 times since I was 15 I’d get sober then relapse sober then relapse sober etc.. I have had legal trouble and been in and out of jail she has been with me through it all, she has always been my better half. No words can explain how blessed I’ve been to have her. This past relapse I was clean for two years before hand and our relationship had never been better we were both happy we both trusted and we both loved no matter what. She helped me get my g.e.d. And she helped me through my grandfathers death (he raised me). I had subtle depression over it I felt like that was normal losing a loved one and all, but I eventually stopped doing the things I was susposed to to maintain my sobriety, I felt like I was cured and no longer needed all the recovery stuff. I was wrong. So one day I decided to take some benzodiazepines and that made me go straight to crystal meth in the time frame of a week I was back shooting meth spending all of my money on it and staying up for days. When on meth I have serious delusions I accused her of cheating on me I actually believed these delusions with my whole heart I felt so betrayed and hurt, I wanted to die. What I feel like really did it was I accused her of cheating on Facebook. Even after multiple people telling me I was wrong I couldn’t believe it, I just KNEW everybody was out to get me especially her, I was very unfair and called her names and called her at all hours of the night, completely out of character of me. After being the good loving boyfriend she knows and loves for two years I suddenly became a monster. I totaled the vehicle I owned and went to jail for possession with intent (Benzodiazepines) possession of marijuana and dui. I sat there for two months (thank god) while I was in there she told me she just couldn’t do this with me anymore and told me she has somebody else in her life, this crushed me. I contemplated suicide while I was in there fought anybody that even remotely rubbed me the wrong way and lost my appetite couldn’t sleep. So I get out and I know that I should just stay away from her because I love her and I don’t want to hinder her pursuing something else, I respected her decision to move on, after all I did publicly humiliate her. So right now I have been sober a month and I feel good in a clear minded healthy way, but I have this hole where she used to be I find myself riding around for hours thinking and crying. I’m very upset that I let this happen, currently I just can’t keep my mind off of her I just want our love and friendship back. I am very depressed and lately I have thought about using again but I would rather kill myself before I do that, I can’t get high anymore I would honestly rather be dead. I’m going to NA meetings, going to church, praying all day, but I can’t seem to ever feel better about losing her no matter what positive things I do. I’d rather be dead then to live without her and I don’t know what else to do.I wanna dieeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Someone fucking kill me pleeeeeeease :)I just ate cereal out of a pot because I was too lazy to wash a single bowl. I honestly have no idea how a day is gonna go anymore. After 8 years... I think I'm doing it, I'm going to sit down and talk to my mom about my depression. I'll do it soon, either the 6th, or 13th. Im not sure how its going to go but hopefully its the step in the right direction.I don't know what it's like to be not depressed. Hi my name is ahmulz and I'm depressed.	1
Whenever I try to tell him about the things my mom says, he says things like "What's wrong with motivating you to get better grades?" or "Your mom doesn't want you to end up like your sisters that she is going to bury because they're 500 pounds." My mom is my bully, and he is her apologist.	0

depression for me like something invisible is suffocating me constantly, literally every waking minute i suffer.	1
After discussing his death for two hours for the study, I realized that the depression I have been feeling for over 12 years is so similar to the feeling I get when I think of my uncle. Intense grief. I delved into the feeling more and have not been able to stop crying for the past few days about my uncle.	1
I don't know. I felt like I'd type more, but it all revolves around money and things I hate about myself and other people.	1
If this matters....	1
I'm not sure I even want to make it to 21.Can people stop telling me that hiking and exercise is the magical cure? It just frustrates me so much, and continues the perpetual cycle of "well if I can't make myself better through such simple actions I must be even more of a failure than I realised".	1
I went to boot camp. I got hurt and it stopped my training. I was heartbroken. I had to come home and move back in with my parents because I had nothing to my name.	1
Now I have a therapist who is ok but I just don‘t vibe with her that much. And I can‘t change because of insurance. Nor do I have the money to pay for one myself since I‘m a broke ass student.	1
I need help. I don't know what to do.i can’t sleep i’ve been planning for my suicide i’ve decided to steal my grandma pills and i’ll swallow all of them. i’m to tired to talk about it i’m 17 and i tried to kill myself more than 10 times and this time i’m so fucking scared because what if i live. i can’t do this anymore i’m so tired Depression-induced forgetfulness is threatening my relationship with my family. Need help urgently. I forget everything, especially the most important things. I forget appointments, I forget items at the store, I forget how to do things, anything that can be forgotten, I forget. I don’t mean to. There is some kind of block in my brain that’s screwing that up due to my many disorders. However, it’s being interpreted as apathy, especially by my parents—they’ve had enough of repeatedly reminding me to do things, and I’m an adult, and they need to concentrate on THEIR lives and what THEY need to do, particularly to help my thirteen-year-old sister blossom now. So this needs to stop. What can I do about this? Medications, cognitive therapy, anything else? I need to save my family ties and my future before they’re completely destroyed.I went to College for Political Science. Now I can't stand politics. When I started college in 2012, my goal was to join the foreign service to represent my country to people abroad. I loathe Trump and all he stands for. My grandmother lost every single relative in Europe to the Nazis, and two days after the election I saw another student at the University come in wearing an SS logo. And with Nazis marching every month I am am ashamed to be American. I have been running behind in college for a while, but as long as I had serving my country to look forward to I kept going. At this point though I would rather be dead than associated with this country.	1
I got up, and went to the porch of attempting life again. A moon vanished above me, showing a pine away from me only just by some measurements. The bicycle appeared broken on the road, as I walked to what I remember being the last resort in this world. I walked to a reused bench, and stared out at the murky waters that felt like memories. I looked to my left, seeing a young boy sitting in the back of a delinquent’s wagon, and to my right a child amongst a smaller group, enjoying the finer delicacies of life. In between it all, a fool.	1

I know she's not really a "friend" more of a "company prostitute" if anything, it seems like I'm always having to buy the booze or lend her money she never pays back.  I know I am being blatantly used, but the company is still better than being alone with my thoughts all of the time.	1
During these 3 months I took out 3 credit cards and ended up maxing them out. I needed food and other essentials that I simply had no money for.	1

I don't know what to do. I thought maybe it would help posting here or something. I don't know.I wrote a poem about depression Little Johny's gone today, Little Johny ran away, Little Johny's at the bay, Little Johny fades away, Little Johny what'd you say?	1
The depression kinda spiraled out of control.	1
Life is so fucking bullshit You think your family cares about you and would do anything to help you, but that's a fucking lie. Both my parents said they went through a "deep depression" that was as bad or worse than mine when they were my age, yet they show 0 interest or care in helping me. I have a sore throat? Oh Jesus go to the walk-in clinic immediately! I say I'm extremely depressed and feel no happiness anymore? Oh yeah we can totally fix that by having a talk every 3 months with you when you have a mental breakdown. I feel like they want me to die since they don't give a flying fuck about my mental state, and when we talk about it they just say shit like I have to be more positive. I've started working out again last week, something I couldn't do for almost a year due to being injured, and I feel nothing from it. I used to love working out so much but now it feels like something that betrayed me, as I'm always gonna be doomed to be skinny because I'm too depressed to have an appetite to eat enough. Fuck sakes I hate my life that's slowly being wasted everyday. I dreamt of being a famous celebrity, but instead I'm here. I know I am depressed but I have no energy to do anything to counter it. I've been searching for a job for 4 months to no avail (I used to have an office job for 4 years before quitting it to take a leap of faith to migrate to another country), and from the second month onward, I've plunged deeper and deeper into depression.	1
Until you crack and have a breakdown,	1
I can’t say anything to anyone, I have learnt that I not only feel alone but I am alone, people just end up getting tired of my shit anyway, so I guess I’ll have to go back to bottling everything inside again, maybe when the glass brakes and I cave i will be free, maybe I will find my freedom in death....idk anymore I just don’t know	1
That’s the first thing.	1
Over the next year, I received a few verbal warnings and 1 written warning at work about my poor performance.  Eventually, the mask broke and I was on leave again in 2015.  This time I was away for much longer, was diagnosed w/ dysthymia, tried several different medications, found out that just about every SSRI gave me horrible side effects (sweating, nausea, insomnia, no sex drive, I'm actually thinking now that maybe they caused serotonin syndrome) and eventually landed on Remeron and Wellbutrin.  This combo actually started to work, without any side effects (except for weight gain, which I've been managing with a diet now).  This time, I returned to work because I received notice in the mail that my employment was going to be terminated because it was coming up on 2 years without being at work.  I figured if I was going to be fired for not returning, I may as well return, make some money and worst thing that happens is I get fired anyways.  I was not better when I returned to work, I was functional, I was able to smile, but the low mood persisted in a big way.	1
Whatever she was describing about perceived proximity to death didn't suit me.	1
I have no future ahead of me. Nothing to look forward too. I go through thousands of career tests and applications and all I see is that I'm either not interested enough or not good enough for any career. And I can't simply work for money. Money in and of itself just isn't good enough for me to work at a job I hate or am completely uninterested in. That's the strain of these minimum wage jobs, some of them I've had to quit because they've literally made me suicidal.	1
One of my closest friends and unfortunately now ex-gf, not only do I still hate myself for how I was but I can't even bring myself to talk to her, I'm just a pathetic waste of a human.	1
I stared blankly into the street, feeling my mind shatter into many jagged pieces. A dam blocked the feeling of humanity and a progress of going up in the world. I picked up the pieces, attaching them to my hurting consciousness. I stomped back to a filthy bed, staring into the bright light that fueled no purpose. I spread a message, the bait missing all parties.	1
I honestly don't look forward to waking up anymore. I can only find peace at night and then I usually get less sleep than I should. Of course I'm 'lazy' for sleeping in. More gets done quicker in less time when I get up than the whole time they've been up.	1

Through out the entire argument, he has called me horrible names and hurt me deep. I thought i was almost over my depression, I thought i was getting better, but the things he has said has taken me from where I thought I was all the way back down to extremely emotional and having suicidal thoughts.	1
Thanks for readingWhen people with good intentions say the wrong shit.. How do you deal with it? When someone who is just trying to help you says something that cuts you really deeply, or when they are pushing you when you just need them to back off while. How do you personally deal with it?	1
I'm 42. I've never held a job with the same company for longer than 3 years, and that was just once. A few times (I think) I've made it to the 2 year mark with a company. 1 year is a bit easier. I had to quit my last job because it was too easy to use the job to fuel the eating disorder. (I lost 40% of my starting weight in about 7 months, before I switched phases and ended up with a pulmonary embolism from refeeding syndrome.) Right now I'm in the initial hurry up and deny me so I can get an attorney phase of applying for disability. Thankfully I have a sister who is letting me live in her house, so at least I'm not homeless. (TBH, most of the time she's out of the country, and when she is here, she's just as selectively social as I am.) Because of waiting to get on disability, I'm off my medicine. I can't even afford the cheapest ACA insurance, and even if I had that, I couldn't afford the copays for my medicine. I'm not eligible for Medicaid in my state until I get approved for SSI/SSDI.	1
The big dream is that he eventually discovers the channel, and with whatever support there is, he will see how much I’ve mentally improved over however long it takes.	1
However, she kept stringing me along until the scan, where she sent me a photo of our child before telling me she wanted to abort it.  Oh, and I had planned a weekend away for us to relax and see some friends.	1
The reason I'm now less likely to commit suicide is actually I won't / can't do this to my mother. We had to plan and pay for the funereal and oh my days it's expensive. Already we were on the line of poverty, and this didn't quite help. I just can't do it to my mother to spend even more money that she doesn't really have. So now the feeling of guilt 'if' I were to do it is bigger than my misery.	1
Things started to feel odd for me, certain sounds and smells and silly things like the wind of my face felt wrong. Like they’d be toned down somehow. Eventually I became completely disconnected from my emotions, save for the occasional moment when I actually find something funny. I’ve been on two types of medication and had therapy too, neither of which did anything for me.	1

Year 5, same class as last year. 3 people joined and 1 of them became a friend of mine. To be completely honest he is still one of my best friends today, but i come back to that later. Lets call him J, Ok so now i had a friend. We had a small group of 3 people now, S (other classmate who was nice to me), J and me. 2 others from another class joined the group somehow and i finally made some friends. We started going to parties and they invited me. Unlucky for me they dont play runescape and have different interests in gaming, thanks to this im not that close to them. But i was finally starting to be happy becuz i had friends. All the small things that bothered me (sitting alone, always last chosen at sports etc etc...), bothered me alot less becuz i was super happy i finally found something positive in my life. I survived year 5 and 6 fairly positive compared to year 1 and 3. We all graduated and college time arrived ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **COLLEGE** This was last year, so this is super recent. I decided to study "orthopedagogie", it doesnt have an english translation. Its working with mentally disabled people or troubled young people, stuff like that. Ofcourse I begged my parents for a student room, i wanted to have a great college life like in the movies! Everyone says its the best time of your life and you should enjoy it to the fullest. Oh boy i was so so dumb for believing it would be that easy. And ofcourse i also joined a society. Finally growing up like an adult and living alone, I WAS FREEEEEEEEEEE. In my class i got along with most of them, we had some good laughs during breaks, went to our class etc... but i was the only one who had a student room (unlucky). So ye that was that. In my society i tried making friends, but it didnt work out really. I missed some first important parties becuz i decided to go with some classmates (i still think to this day that this was a huge mistake), when i went to parties alone to make friends  (because i realized my class was lame) they already a "friend group". I didnt know (and still dont) how to make contact with them and make friends.	1

When I get home, all I want to do is either sleep or sit in front of my computer. When I am on my computer, I never do anything productive, just get into YouTube holes that last forever. I try to be creative; maybe try game design, or start writing; but it all just falls flat and I feel worse, not good enough.	1
I’m glad for this subreddit and that there’s people who understand my pain. When I look in the mirror.. I ask the person I see, "who are you?" I follow up with a "fuck you."I just want to get this off my chest My depression comes and goes, same for my anxiety. The doctor said its that I have an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Somedays I feel fine, others I feel crushing loneliness. I'm 28. Never had a girlfriend and have become distant from my friends. I have no idea of how to meet new people. I just... I dunno, sometimes it feels like I should have my life on track by now. My sisters were married at this point, meanwhile, I never had an intimate relationship nor even a small idea of how to start one. I see people with successful careers, homes, families at my age, yet I feel like I'm just going day to day growing older with nothing to look forward to. I don't want to kill myself but sometimes I wish I just ceased to be. My hobbies don't feel fulfilling any longer and sometimes I just want to sleep the morning away mainly to make the day shorter. I can't even force myself to enjoy parties because I feel this pressure on the back of my neck and after a while and it becomes unbearable. I need to leave to feel better and yet I feel worse in loneliness.	1

I dont feel anything or enjoy anything. today is my birthday :) Today is my birthday. 8th alone. 22 today, a number that i never would've thought i would reach. I bought some of my favorite snacks and got my old blanket, just going to watch some of my favorite movies today. I also bought a card for myself ( which i do every year) , written on it was "Happy Birthday, Love mum and dad"... they were the last people to ever tell that to me and i know that even tho its been over a decade since they're gone, they were the last people to celebrate and be happy because of me, the last people to love me. i miss them so much. I get so lonely, its hard to cope sometimes, i wish i could spend more time with them. I love you mum and dad :)	1
Maybe I enjoy being depressed? Because obviously I've laid out terms, so to speak, for me to be depressed. Not courageous, hard enough working, kind etc etc. Yet, I don't do shit about it. So why complain as if I'm depressed because of it? I think that's where the day to day numb feeling comes in. It's like "I am this way. I don't like being this way. I don't change being this way. Why tf are you even upset?"	1
There's no helping me. I am just supposed to feel miserable. I'll never be happy. I'm not sure at this point if I even want to be happy anyways.	1

What did I do to deserve a life like this? Why can’t I be okay?Women ignore me, even here, they think I'm unworthy or too ugly to be helped. I even have the stats to prove it. Why am I so undeserving of love? I made a post yesterday today asking for help as to why I'm undatable and why no women wants to go out with me. I got 450+ views and only 6 comments, only 1 of which was from a woman. Everyone else was a male who either tried to give some advice or made fun of me. Here's proof: https://imgur.com/a/TRWg3	1
I'm finally going to start taking meds so hopefully in about a month I'll start getting my life back. Hell even if these particular meds don't agree with my system, just the fact that I've taken my first steps in my journey is enough hope for me! Just venting Not sure the general gist of where this post is going but I just kind of want to write down my thoughts. I tend to feel better after I do so. Maybe along with that I can have the added bonus of affecting somebody else in a positive way with what I say or that someone else understands what I'm saying.	1
Honestly I feel bad every day. I get to work an hour late and dread it, for no reason. It's not hard and I generally enjoy it while I'm there. I feel almost certain that I'm depressed, but why? I feel bad about that. I own my own house, my own car, and have no real money problems, yet I feel like shit constantly. My sister is a recovering addict. I've seen how low people can go, yet I'm not even close. I've generally been lucky and have done reasonably well for myself, yet I still feel down. No real life partner to speak of, very few friends. But I feel that being upset and down about it is wrong because so many people have it so much worse.	1
It feels like a failure, but I gave it my best try, and it isn't working out.	1

The place we’re interested in is a 6 bedroom house, I personally wouldn’t mind an all female house or with 2 boys and 4 girls idc. But my coursemate said she’d prefer 3 girls and 3 boys. Well so far we have 4 confirmed girls (me, coursemate and a girl that SHE found), i’m currently getting enquiries from girls and a few guys but if i’m doing this on a first come first served basis, it’s looking to be an all girls house.	0
Any advice on how to manage/process my emotions? Or just how to better understand myself?Falling back into it I'm 16, and this weekend, I got into a big argument with my girlfriend of 7 months. We hadn't seen each other in 2 weeks, and our plans to see each other fell through. I tried to save our plans, but she seemed disinterested. I was so distraught and caught up in sadness and self-hatred that I, wanting to distance myself from the situation, not just leaving it alone, told her I wanted to break up with her out of sheer emotional irrationality. It turns out I was sadder without her, and she reached out to me to talk soon later. We got back together, and she said she was okay. The way she described the whole situation let me know she understood my plight completely, but I ruined her that day and she's been off ever since. She painted her nails black, screamed at her parents, texted all her friends to tell them how much of a terrible person I was, wrote "Anon is a piece of shit cunt" in her bathroom mirror in sharpie, and cried all day from the story she told.	1
Everyday I feel and believe that things just keep getting heavier to deal with. That my life will not become healthier and I won’t ever be happy. It’s one issues after the next, or all at once and I keep wanting (sometimes do) push it off to the side.	1
Before i was friend with her, i had a depression but it wasnt that bad. I didnt have friends then so i didnt have to go through what i have now,	1
Right now, I just want to fast forward to like March or April. I don't want to deal with my birthday, since the plans I had with my ex-girlfriend are obviously not happening anymore, most of my friends are busy with work and school, and my family is still not back to being normal. Nobody seems to want to do much for my birthday anyways, which is, for lack of a better word, normal for me. When I got home from work this morning, I cried thinking about it all. I've never had that kind of emotional reaction to anything before.	1
"Somebody else probably said it already."	1
Isn’t it just like me to start taking the advice I’ve been given by so many people my entire life.	1
Like the title says, I feel like I am in a rut. I am tired 100% of the time, regardless of the sleep I have had (quality, length, etc). Feel simultaneously under-utilized and under-qualified for my job at the moment. I don't feel like I am doing anything worth-while, but I also don't even feel qualified to do even this job.	1
TLDR: Stop oversimplifying a serious illnessI’ve completed step one I’m killing myself this year. Not sure when, but I’m really hoping I can make it happen. Last week, I had a wild night in the shower with a lot of vodka and a razor, posted one last snap on my story with a waving emoji, then went full white noise. No snapchat, no instagram, no Facebook, nothing. Broke all my streaks. Now I have no contact with anyone at all. I avoid the people I know at meal times. I stay in my room  and game, or start the long list of letters I have to write to people. The sad thing is, I could have been dead almost a week and no one would know. No one has come to my room to check on me, or message me to ask if I’m ok. No ones seen or heard from me in days. I’ve pushed everyone away. Step 1 is complete. I️ owe 31k in student loans, my mom owes 52k in PLUS loans on my education. I️ feel so terrible.. I’m the first of my 3 siblings to go to college. I got depressed and wasted a year. Now I’m on my 5th year and I won’t graduate till one more semester in the fall. I’ve been working too but I only make enough to cover some of my living expenses. My school schedule only lets me work around 30 hours a week. My mom has helped me out by taking out Parent PLUS loans for me which she is responsible to repay after I graduate. So far she owes $52k while I owe $31k. I feel so shitty, I can’t believe Ive put her through all of this. My dad doesn’t work so it’s just her, and my siblings have yet to finish college (one of them is starting in a couple years). I’m so pissed off at myself, how did I let this happen? If I had my act together I could’ve graduated earlier. I hate myself so much for this, I always prided myself on keeping my mom from harm but she’s going to be in so much debt. It’s so unfair, if I had thought this through maybe she wouldn’t be in this position. Im so close to graduation but so fucking scared. What if I don’t get a job right away? I always said I’d repay my loans then repay my mom but $52k is so much money. More than I’ve ever seen in my life. I’m just taking advantage of her at this point. I’m such a fucking trainwreak.	1
After more talking we met, we drove round and spent a few hours just chilling and talking it was fun but something wasnt right. I have these little games I play to kind of 'test the waters', nothing creepy just some fun light flirting like a play full punch to the arm or lean myself a bit closer in watching a video or something, harmless stuff but the reactions tell you the story. Long story short it wasnt the story I was hoping for, nothing was reciprocated and there was just no positive body language (I know im sounding like some sort of socially awkward overly analytical weirdo here but trust me its just the best way I can describe it over text).	1
Personally, I've been close to do it, but my online friends gave me so much support and so much love that I noticed that it's not worth it. I still have things I want to do. Sure getting out of bed is still a huge task. Today it took me 2 hours just to do it, but I did it.	1
I know the problem is with me, and that I’m sabotaging my relationships (as I always do and have done for many years). I feel guilty about it, especially knowing that I’m lucky to even have friends. But the truth is, I find people exhausting, and whenever I’m with them I just feel lonelier that when I’m alone. I end up getting snappy. It’s like I’m watching myself destroy my relationships but I don’t know how to stop. Hanging out with people makes me unhappy. Beginning to think I should become a hermit out in the woods on my own.	1
A shadow stood behind my forgotten figure, taunting the fullness above it. I wore a jacket and yelled at it, and it shyly walked. I took a deep breath and walked outside toward the bench once again, staring out at the beautiful waters. A creature came from the waters, approaching me. I held its hand, standing up accordingly. The creature pushed me into a pit full of spikes, as I awoke to half of me missing. I felt a burning inside of me, as my insides waned into a fine drawing of genitalia, washing the deliberate feeling and thought around my head, causing me to let out of a horrific screech of losing a natural ability.	1
I am genuinely glad to not be friends with her anymore. She made the worst of assumptions about me, turned on me when SHE fucked up and made it MY fault, and got hyper-defensive and toxic  in her behavior while simultaneously calling me dysfunctional. Hindsight is 20/20, and I feel like she had too much to do with her baby, couldn't say no, and resented the task in the first place. She said she didn't come home every night and think "I'm not going to work on typesetting tonight, just to piss off Plethora" as if good intentions can't pave the road to hell and hurt people. I said we were shitty to each other, but she won't admit fault at all. And I know I don't need a judgemental perfectionist in my life.	0
It's hard though. It hurts me to push people away. But it's for the best. I wish I had no attachments. I wish I had no family or friends to try to connect with, I don't want them to be sad when I die. My ultimate goal in life since I was 13 was to die in peace without any attachments to the world, or leaving enough money for my family. They shouldn't have to waste their care and time on someone like me. It only takes a small amount of light to feel the suffocating strength of darkness A quote from the game "Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice" that I felt relates to depression.

I’m so full of regret and guilt and self hatred all the time. I hurt my family so much, and I continue to. I’ve had multiple emotional breakdowns since, when pretending to be okay just becomes too much. I’ve made my parents so concerned for me. Not only do they constantly think I’m high now, and do not hesitate to think every single fucking broken thing is my fault because I got “too fucked up”, but with the emotional rants I’ve had I’m sure they think im about to blow any second and kill myself.	1
As we did my view of him started to crumble, but was rebuilt after living together surprisingly worked remarkably well. We grew more towards each other and were best friends on top of lovers. In between this life changing chapter and where I am now, he has had a few strikes I simply can not forget. While I was once open to share my ups and downs and sadness with him, now I’d rather not. Because where I once trusted him to hold me, I now trust him to ridicule me and tell me to man the fuck up. And the stubborn ass I am, I do, but this comes with resentment. But to explain the strikes:	1
So yeah I guess this is a little longer than it needs to be, but, yeah. Helping random people feels good and distracts from my depression a little. Is what I was saying.	1

EDIT:You guys are amazing. Thank you, I’ve taken all your advice into account. I appreciate it all. I don’t even want to write this post I just wish I had the fulfilling family experience like everyone of my other friends did. But instead I got a drug addict mom and a emotional incompetent dad who I regularly got into emotional skirmishes a lot when I was younger. Im the product of verbal abuse and emotional neglect and it haunts to every single day of my life. This affects me in ways like not being productive at all when I get close to deadlines, not being to emotionally relate to anyone because my internet sense of judgement and risk management are fucked up, I have self destructive tendencies that I use as coping mechanisms, I hop on the rollercoaster of life and hope and pray sometimes that it would fling me off the tracks. I don’t even know if any of this makes sense because of the conflicting thoughts I’m always having about whether or not I believe or don’t believe that this life is worth living. I’m trying every single day, I’m trying my hardest to keep it together, I’m trying my absolute fucking hardest to keep moving forward but I am consistently being stopped or held back by the dread and anguish of waking up to a life that I don’t even want to fucking live.Wrote this poem today I'm not sure, not sure	1
How many more expansions of diagnosis in the dsm? does it have to be to wake you sheeples up that Collectivising human behaviour and giving them a label of “disease” with symtomps does it have to be to tell you that these behaviours aren’t found through cellular pathology, brain scans, blood tests, or some medical diagnostic criteria?	1
going through life waiting for it all to end soon i got nothing going for me in my life. im 22 and never had a girlfriend. you know what, i never even had a friend..guy or girl. im tired of going to college and doing meaningless work and for what? so i can join the rat race? i dont want to grow old, it's only going to get worse as i age, especially healthwise. im totally awkward, can't make conversation beause there's nothing interesting about me,and im really ugly..so that means no one would even bother taking an interest in me and approach me to really talk.  like that would be one of the major reasons why i never even had a friend, not to mention a girlfriend! and im poor, so i dress stupid.  it's the same thing every single day, i go to school, don't talk to anyone, and go home. i dont even have a job, and i dont drive. i just hope i go away soon, like get a terminal illness, that would make everything so much easier. i don't know, i'm just rambling here. i can't really describe everything in words here, you would have to be in my shoes to really get it, so to speak.Today is gonna be tough I have been doing okay for a bit now and haven't really been in a slump for a couple weeks but today I can't help it. Been thinking all of last night about it and now I am pretty torn up.	1

Been feeling great for 2-3 months now. Im starting to not feel so great anymore... help[Need Advice] Need anti depressants but I don't want my mum to know about it. Hello guys, I am 17 and I live in Singapore with my Mum. I have been depressed on and off for the past 5 years with serious suicidal thoughts for the last 4.	1
How do I get people to be my friend though? I don't smell, I am ugly but I try to cover that up best I can with makeup. I just want to feel like I belong somewhere with someone. I lost my closest So recently one of my biggest fears came true. I don’t have many friends and that’s because I always feared that a friend would know me and just completely hate me. So I only had like two or three friends for this reason. Then I was diagnosed with depression, so I tried to tell my best friend at the time that I had depression and that over the last year or so that may be why I had done some weird drastic things (in this time I never did anything to harm my friend emotionally or physically). While I was telling him he became hostile towards me and then told who told his girlfriend who in turn became hostile towards me and told me I was a shit person (A shit father and a shit boyfriend). That was 3 months ago. So I stopped talking to them because of that I tried going to my closest friend about something I never talked about ever to anyone and it caused them to walk away. Then I sought out help and I started to recover from the issue the and I made regular updates about on Facebook because I was finally ready to talk about my issue, but one day when I said I lost a friend him and the other person I thought was my friend attacked me in the comments because I made a side comment about what happened between us. I never mentioned names. I tried to move on with my life but they were the only friends I really had and I so completely distraught because I don’t know what to do or honestly really how to make new friends. I feel like now since it has finally happened to me I can deal with people who I thought were friends turning their backs on me but I just don’t know how to make friends. Can I get some advice on what to do. Also I’m a 22 year old guy with a baby and a happy relationship. Do I even need friends?Friend problems So my school is a small school so in my class there’s only 10-12 people. I currently have a friends let’s call them Monica and natalie. I hang out with them but, I’m always the  second one. By second one, I mean like a second choice. When one of them isn’t at school or aren’t with them, they’ll come to me. It’s a problem when I have to get a pair for class activities like in PE. I had a friend who I thought she could be my real friend. I’ll call her hailey. I one told her a secret and she spoiled it to the whole school. I still gave her a chance. She started being really harsh on me and what I like which is photography. She would always insult me and say negative things that makes me think negative. I realized that we didn’t really go well and that our interests are very different. So We kinda stopped hanging out often. I tried my best to be funny and social. My friendship between my friends (Natalie and Monica)  were getting better but I was still the one that they didn’t really care. Now hailey is trying so hard to be friends with Monica, Natalie and maybe me. Natalie knows that she’s trying to “be like us” but Monica doesn’t. Monica is slowly hanging out with hailey. Hailey started to ask me what I like to wear and all the small stuff. And she also wouldn’t stop talking about my crush and his best friend. Which is uncomfortable for me. her personality changed and I realized she is actually trying to be like my friends.  I currently don’t know who should I be friend with since I don’t have a best friend. It’s quite embarrassing when I have to get a pair because I have no one. I don’t know what to do.Apologizing to a family member ? Not sure if this is the right place to put this?  If it’s not feel free to direct me!  To sum it up,  I’ve highly offended a family member of mine.  I wrote this apology that I can’t bring myself to send them.  I kept telling them how much I wanted to see them and I even flew up to see everyone.  When we were all seated at a restaurant I was having really bad anxiety and didn’t really speak to anyone.  He took this really personal and felt I came off as an asshole.  I didn’t know how to explain the anxiety part of things to him so I gave him a lame excuse about eating spoiled food the night before.  While it was true it wasn’t the reason I wasn’t speaking to anyone.  Then I had went to his house to try and speak to him as I was leaving the next day and he told me not to come.  I did anyway and you can imagine that didn’t end well at all.  He won’t talk to me.  I finally found the courage to type up this apology.  It explains the conditions I suffer from, how they’re debilitating and the trauma I endured that caused them.  The apology I feel is oversharing but I also wanted to explain myself in full and be as genuine as I possibly can.   Nobody knows the things I went through but I’m going to post the apology here for you guys to read for yourselves.  Please don’t judge me too harshly I just don’t want this family member to never talk to me again.   I understand it may come off as a pity me type of thing but I promise it’s not.	0
but then i think maybe i’m just overreacting to the word “happy” because i’m more comfortable being sad. i’ve been sad for so long that there’s a certain comfort in it. sad is familiar. happy is unknown and risky.	1
My ex girlfriend broke up with me and moved out of our apartment 6 months ago now. The almost three years we were together were the only time in my life where my depression was pretty much nonexistent. When she came home that day and told me she was done, I was floored. I had no idea that she felt the way she did, and she wouldn't even discuss the matter with me.	1
One day my Father shows up to my school drunk, gets arrested, I am taken in by the state and put into foster care. I end up living with an incredibly poor hispanic family and eat almost nothing everyday. I have no bed. I sleep on the floor.	1
You know guys, we have all been there, in that cold and lonely place. For some, this place will be terrifying and called depression, for others it might be something less severe. But we don’t care. If it is important enough for you to feel bad about it, then it would be an honor for us to hear about it.	1

Instead I graduated with a shitty degree, no future, more debt than I can handle, and no real way to start improving this future.

Maybe I'm overreacting and have too much pride in me or no balls to admit to my family but sometimes I wish I could get invisible for just a week to sort my inner problems out. Sorry If this feels like I'm trying to make it harder for you guys to make some suggestions. It's way more complicated than that I just wanted to let it out. I've read some posts here and some of them were so so dark that my problems actually fade away a bit and I felt better because I said to my self *"yo... you are being a bitch right now, look at these people suffering here, you aren't even close!"* (don't know if I'm being terrible for healing my little wounds by reading how other people suffer). Anyways, Idk why I haven't visited this sub earlier, as I type these last words I already feel better because it is the first time I'm doing something like this. Feels like I've talked to someone. Thank you!Journal Entry - 12:23AM Monday, December 4th, 2017 Just thought I'd share my thoughts from last night.

For so long I've been completely alone and it really sucked.  I managed to connect with my Cousin a couple of years ago and we've had a lot of great times, but more often than not lately it seems I feel bad after dropping her off instead of good that we hung out.	1
I don't think I can handle that.	1

Dealing with loneliness? I can’t speak to a therapist, I can’t change my reality, I can’t even really take a step forward. My situation is what it is; there is no solution at the moment. I have to live and deal with where I’ve gotten myself, and I have to continue to work to get myself to a different place, so loneliness is my reality. I truly don’t have anyone to talk to right now. Haven’t really for a while. Does anyone have any tips on dealing with loneliness? I’ve been dealing with it in very unhealthy ways lately. I need to figure out how to accept it and live with it.Threatened with being forcibly removed from the graduate program unless I meet an impossible deadline. I never asked to be born...seems unfair we can't choose to die Hi, so they call this "Major Depressive Disorder" and i do take medication for it, but i dont know maybe im just being a realist? Not everyone is meant for this world: i'm awkward, a failure, ugly, and poor. I'm too scared to jump off a cliff or anything violent, i wish i could take those drugs that makes you die peacefully in your sleep...but that's only for cancer patients (terminally ill) or whatever. I'm being forced to live, it's awful.I probably ruined everything Tonight I ruined almost a year of work. My girlfriend of 12 years and I had a really rough 10 months, and I have been working really hard to build up our relationship. However, tonight my depression and an existential crisis got the best of me, and I made a stupid decision. I tried to steal a bunch of things from Walmart, but I got caught. Her sister is the manager, and was the one who caught me. I told my girlfriend and she didn’t say anything. I’m worried that I’m going to lose her. If I lose her, I’ll have nothing. I may as well not exist, because she is my only source of happiness. I know I don’t deserve her, but I need her desperately.Why am I an idiot? I always feel the need to be loved by someone else. So I am constantly trying to talk to a girl and get a date. I actually went on a date recently. A couple weeks ago I hit it off with this girl from another school nearby and we had a lot in common. We vibed really well and seemed to have similar feelings for each other. We talked for a couple of weeks and then we went on a date. I think we both enjoyed ourselves but we didn’t talk as often afterwards. I blame myself for that because I feel like I should have been more social with her. We don’t talk anymore and I wish I still talked to her but it has been a weird amount of time since our date and I don’t know how to go about it. When I finally get a chance to have a girlfriend like I feel I need, I fuck it up. Does anybody have any idea of what I can do with this situation?There is a big chance that I will become a millionaire in a year or 2 I got involved in Bitcoin 2 years ago, bought a lot when it was 500 600 dollars. And based on my bitcoin increasing from trading altcoins and the increasing value in general I believe I can seriously become a millionaire in a year or 2. I am depressed though. I want to figure out how I can reinvest that money. Not for the purpose to make more but how I can make other aspects of my life better. I'd really like to hear what people think.	1
I have had quite an uncertain year since graduating, so maybe it is that quarter-life crisis.	1
It's definitely aggravated this feeling.	1
It's still so hard to say goodbye. I've been doing my best to spend time with her and my visiting family but the grief and depression are kicking my ass. I can't do anything. I have a huge paper due this week and work has been insanely stressful. I can't even manage to get my laundry done and I'm buying and eating shit food that is bankrupting me.	1
P.P.S. Fuck you E, I’m sorry I disappointed you that I didn’t die yet even my diagnosis’ average life span is 6 months. Don’t worry, it’s coming. And I surely fucking hope karma is real. It’s fucking people like you who deserve such things and what do you fucking get? A nice family, a handsome face, people who likes to be around you. You’re one of the people who deserve my revenge and yet I’m being like a pussy who is letting a fake thing called “karma” take care of everything. In this fucking lifetime, not a single one got any karma. (or maybe my parents did by god giving me cancer but idk they just labelled me as a liability and now has dropped me like a hot potato so that’s really more on me than on them)	1
Stranger: also, just keep trying new things, and doing whatever, because what does it matter anyways?	1
On Dec.12th I lost all interest in anything. I used to escape in video games but now I can't. I load up Ark and just stare. I've anxiety about everything.

I think it's probably the campus merger (some background info: my university originally have 3 campuses, 2 of them are quite small, hence closed down now, unluckily mine included and the students from those programs are gonna merge with the larger campus.) Its like there's something wrong but I can't pinpoint it. I just felt that I should probably get this off my chest, before it eats me from the inside out.I have no friends. It’s sucks to have no real friends besides your coworkers with questionable morals and values Anyone else read books as a form of escapism? I know for some people depression can be so crippling that you can’t even find the motivation to pick up a book let alone focus long enough to read it. That used to be me although I’ve always been interested in reading and loved it until my depression became that crippling. But since getting put on adderall for my ADD, I’m able to get back into reading books. Mostly fantasy books	1
She actually "ghosted" me about a year ago for a few months and that put me in a really bad place, I had to check into the psych ward I was in such a rut over it.  When we finally started hanging out again she didn't seem to care at all the pain it caused me, and I still have never heard an answer "why" she'd block me and dodge my calls or visits out of the blue.	1
It's a very passive depression.	1
I can hardly work, because I can't complete thoughts very well any more, being so depressed.	1
You: yeah	1
Let me stress this - I am definitely not having any suicidal thoughts.	1
I’m lost. "You don't have it bad enough"/"You only think about yourself" Got into a discussion with my SO because of my depression/anxiety. They told me I don’t have it bad enough and if I were worse off I’d get my shit together. So something in me snaps and I admit I’d actually rather be dead (whoops). This leads to them telling me I’m only thinking about myself and asking me how I believe they feel when I tell them I want to die.	1
All my friends have at least an idea of what they want to do, but I dont even have the beginnings of a clue as to what I want to do with the rest of my life. And to be honest, Im scared of becoming an adult. Managing a budget, doing taxes, paying bills, and shit like that. Im not fucking prepared for it. If I cant deal with the stress of a fucking video game, then I sure as hell cant deal with a job.	1
I struggle with depression myself and I just wish I could've talked to her, I know we could've related on some level. That almost excites me, getting to relate to someone, even over something sad, to just feel that. Thanks for listening.	1
The whole "your brain is lying about how bad things are" thing often just feels like "you're just imagining your problems". Like, I know depression etc make your brain incapable of dealing with them properly, but it doesn't mean legitimate problems don't exist and that some people's lives aren't thoroughly worthless all the same.Get myself to be more active/alive? So, my depression is getting worse and worse since a few years. I'm in law school and I'm in the last year of preparation - in our country, this is THE BUSIEST TIME ever for those students - like, they start studying at 7 in the morning at stay until 11 in the night at the library. nonstop studying for 1-1,5 years in preparation for the big exams.	1
Anyway she went to the hospital and was there for about a month. I ended up skipping a lot of school to be able to care for and do all the general house duties for my younger brothers. (11yrs old and 1yr old at the time.). Things progress my mom misses a lot of work we end up moving with my grandma.	1
Currently, my closest friends are my coworkers but they the most judgmental people I've known. We became close by commiserating together at work. Fast forward a few years, I am finally starting to feel better after seeking help for my depression. I've been seeing a therapist for over a year, began taking antidepressants two months ago, and have been taking cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. As I begin to feel better, I also feel more miserable hanging out with my friends.	1
But I love him to death, when he is around, he supports me. But the moment he stops, he acts like I don't exist. It's tearing me apart. I'm scared to talk to him about it because I don't want him to hate me anymore than I feel like he already does, but I just don't know what to do about it.	1
Me: "It doesn't work the same for everyone you IDIOT!"	1
Edit: I'm less worked up after writing that... sorry if this isn't the place or I broke the rules or whatever... but really... how? Why?I feel like depression has turned my brain into mush and now I can’t be successful in anything Last year I stopped being productive at work and it’s now seeping into the rest of my life. I used to receive accolades for being great at my job. I was even at the top in the nation at my job when they looked at my metrics and sales. But now I’m just sad all of the time and I can’t think straight.	1
i never feel really happy. am i doing something wrong? am i to be like this forever? why would i continue if this were the case?Help Me.. I feel so alone and depressed..and everyone on the internet hates me and people stare at me everywhere..it makes me feel so shit..and I have no joy to do anything anymore I need help...Anyone already afraid of Valentine's Day? If not, what's your method for not getting even more suicidal that day?From the moment I wake up I wish I was still asleep. Thats the hardest part about going to bed at night you know? I'd love to just sleep forever but every night I have trouble going to bed knowing I'm gonna wake up. It's the worst part of the day. Im ready to leave my therapist? I have 14 months in psychotherapy and 11 months with SNRI for dysthymia.	1
English isn’t my first language so some things might sound rough, but I hope I was able to get my message across Am I Depressed? While I've been distraught and suicidal on and off since age fifteen, I've never been formally diagnosed with anything because I don't trust the mental-health establishment. I've only visited a shrink twice: once when forced by parents, a second time when pressured by a partner.	1
If you need anything, message me. Tired Im so tired i dont wanna get up in the morning. So tired, making me skip school. So tired, i cant even play video games. So tired, i wanna cut off all connections. So tired, i dont wanna do anything. So tired.im just so tired, that i dont wanna do anything anymore. Spending Valentine’s Day alone... when I shouldn’t be. Over the weekend, I told a girl who i thought liked me too about how I felt about her and I asked if she wanted to go to dinner on Valentine’s Day. I thought it’d be a nice thing... her and I are very similar, we don’t have great social skills, we both write for our schools newspaper and other crap. Her response was nice, but I feel like I totally fucked up with a beautiful girl. I’ve never really had anything with a girl and I’m 21 years old. So, I guess I’m alone tmrw when I could’ve asked the girl if she just wanted to hang out. Just being in her presence is so fun, but now I feel so much negative tension between us.	1
I'm not too worried about not having my antidepressants right now tho. This is probably the most pleasant major depressive episode I've ever had. It's not so much feeling horrible psychic pain as it's just been a gentle bleeding out of the vibrancy of life. I sleep as late as I can every day, (usually until around 1 or so), hang out in bed playing games, reading, or watching videos, and only really waking up and being willing to be awake around 7 in the evening.	1
i come from Christianity so i guess the idea of me possibly having depression is so surreal to me. i've thought of suicide nearly every day since this year's started. some days every hour. every minute. constantly. sometimes i daydream about it. sometimes the thoughts make me sad. sometimes i'm so mad at myself i want to make the thoughts a reality, blood and all. sometimes the thoughts get so bad, so gory and so tragic. i'm sorry i guess there's something wrong with me, i feel scared because i feel like i'm being pushed over the edge and i can't do anything about it. i talk to myself, in actual back and forth convos, completely with laughing and inside jokes and even some 'us' 'we' and the like pronouns thrown in (sounds like so many other internet posts lmao). it started as a imaginary friend, and just kinda went from there as I trimmed the fat. it helped. i've been so abysmally lonely most of my life. i have a gf and puppy now. she knows i'm depressed, but i can't tell her how much. i can't tell her that i scope out the highway water bridges for places i can park. or at least walk to. i'm trying so hard. on one hand i know what killing myself would do to her. but some times it gets so dark. sometimes it gets so bad i know she'll be overjoyed to see my corpse. sometimes i think about killing myself in front of her, or my co workers. i think about dying, every day, every minute, every second. i think about dying painfully. i'm smoking all the weed i can and i try not to think about it. i just tell myself i'm venting, mentally. i've never attempted. its just ideation.	1
When I was sure I was ready, I told him. It was too late. I took too long.	1
I want to ditch every single one of them, but I honestly don't have any other close friends outside of this group. I'm trying my best to find new friends, and if that happens, I 'll happily leave these people who consider depression sufferers "dark and unstable and unsafe". Just needed to rant	1
So considering everything I went into today expecting just the congratulations and that’s it, turns out my entire family went out to eat and celebrate the birthday of a family friend and left me behind.	1
But the question is, i’m i stressed, depressed or burnt out? Anyone have been in a similar case?	1
That's the conclusion I came up with anyway	1
Recent mistakes (Failing in my university units, failing to find a job, failure in relationship) are making me nihilistic, self loathing and just feeling really pathetic. But of course, I can't just keep using my mistakes as an excuse to not get the fuck up and do something with my life... but I think I have ran out of ideas and motivation to push myself anymore. I've never really had a personality Honestly can't remember having much of a 'personality' I just remember being a very compassionate and empathetic person when I was younger, but now I've lost that after depression.	1
I'm also desperately single. I haven't been in a relationship, let alone just dated someone, in years. And it's soul crushing. I see all these happy couples around campus, beautiful men and women, having the time of their lives with each other. And I'm so fucking jealous man. I want that happiness so desperately bad. I want to love someone, I want to FEEL loved! I want someone to help me through days like today, and to be there for them when they have those days. I want the cheesy shit like cuddling and laughing over stupid stuff. I want the inevitable times where we're pissed at each other about something, but we work through it and end up going crawling up next to each other in bed at the end of the night, and wake up to see each other to start the day. I'm tired of waking up to this massive empty bed, cold and alone.	1
"It's just a phase " ( it's not =) )	1
I tried to support and encourage him with everything. Emotionally and financially. I pushed myself to work 30+hrs a week when I was anxious and depressed because he became so closed off, so we had a roof over our head and food in our belly when we were made homeless. I tried to help him with being motivated to work, and to be able to support himself.	1
I am by no means struggling with my faith but rather where does the line cut off between having faith that things will turn out versus just not giving a shit about anything hoping things will turn out?	1
My grades are fucked, I’m fuckin stupid, I’m goddamn hideous, and I fuck up everything I see, I finally see why nobody fucking wants me, I’m just a fucking burden to everyone I know, and every time I attempt suicide I fuck it up cuz I’m a fucking moron... my therapy didn’t work, antidepressants made me feel worse, I guess I’m a hopeless human being. I mean I don’t deserve to be loved or cared about, when there are so many other people who are smarter better and more mentally stable than I am.When I lie in bed, I look forward to living in the dream world inside of my head. There, I am the person I’ve always wanted to be. I’m loved, safe, and happy. But when morning comes and I wake up, reality sinks in like a brick. My youth is gone and I’m still a failure, and I wish I never woke up. I have tried so hard through most of my life to feel accomplished, to live a life I can be proud of. To love and be loved. But every day is another act of failure and rejection. The days get heavier and heavier. I’ve run out of strength. I want to stay in my bed. I want to stay in my dream world.	1
