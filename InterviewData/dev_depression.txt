I mean if this is all im gonna be as a person even after all this hard work... what's the point. At the end of the day the only thing i really end up looking forward to is sleeping.  It's honestly the only time I feel okay.	1
At this very moment nothing but suicidal and depressing thoughts envelop my mind its taking every fiber of my being to not load my gun and just end it. I dont want to solve my problems like that.	1
I am a lazy, unmotivated person who is notorious for making excuses for herself. I really need some guidance. I hate waking up. I hate getting out of bed. I do not even want to shower or function. I don't know what to do. i have to get this out, goodnight on my instagram, i post a message every night telling people not to hurt themselves and other things that might make them feel better. every night, and i've gotten at least a 100 messages back telling me how much i've helped.	1
I texted Amy Tuesday that I was feeling down and I'd like to see her. I made a big deal about how I wasn't crying about the Pats, but I was having an episode. It seemed important to me to point that out for some reason. She said someone was visiting from our India office and had a ton of work for her, but she would try to come over after. She worked until 930 that night and never made it.	1
So tell me, do you have a definite definition of what it meant to be happy?They told me that all they can do is replace my hard drive, but they can't recover my 10 years of bitter-sweet memories. So I bought an external hard drive, thinking that everything would be safe on it, right? If I'm gonna spend $50 on something, it should at least be good at something, right?	1
We kept talking the next day and that evening she didn't reply to one my texts, I tried to think nothing of it because it wasn't really a question or anything and tried to restart the conversation but nothing again.	1
The observant man coming by on a bicycle or on his own two legs could notice the hurting expression that shone on my face. An insomnia that has outlasted its course, half a heart to spare to the one it belongs to, and the tonnes lying on his stubby shoulders. Whether the man is out to care for their dog, the mail, something; they always take a look to glance at the face of a broken child, often not realizing the fine details in the street lights glowing on my frozen cheeks.	1
I understand that depression is awful and people suffer from it, I see what it does to people on this sub. I just wanted to add my experience, since it's different to everyone else's.	1
The thing is I am racking my brain and trying to think what I could have done to upset her - if anything, and I can‚Äôt think of anything. I have questioned whether I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself but then not having her around makes me miss her and feel hurt that she‚Äôs suddenly decided to stop talking to me for whatever reason. The thing is I have been considering what loss it would be for me to not be friends with her anymore - It wouldn‚Äôt be easy for me as she is one of the only few people I still speak to from my school days and we could relate so much to each other.	0
I‚Äôm just going to go to sleep.	1
Time froze like huh? :/üò® Also I'm 30 shes 35.	0
This is the worst it has been. Usually i go home for a bit to take my mind off things, or can occupy my time with videos games or something to take my mind off things. Nothing is fun right now. Not turning to alcohol is hard. I really feel like things will get better but..... how fucking long does it take? What do i do until then?I'm 20 years old today The one thing I wanted for my birthday would've been a relationship. I feel so lonely all the damn time, and the one girl who I admitted my feelings to AND apparently likes me back is already dating someone else.	1
But most of all, I'm tired of pretending. Of having to pretend. To wear this mask every single fucking day of my life just to pretend to be normal. Just so my coworkers won't think I'm weird. Just so my mom won't go off about how I just need to get my shit together. Just so I can hold up the chance that one day I'll be able to overcome my massive wall of social anxiety and try to talk to someone, make a friend, maybe meet a girl.	1
I'm not sure, not sure	1
So I tried to find a full time job, and I did. Then got laid off not too soon after due to ‚Äúbudget cuts.‚Äù My first time experiencing adulthood.	1
I don't know if I hate myself or this economy more, but I just wish I could go far away sometimes. Just leave everyone behind and find somewhere to sit and do nothing. Listen to a waterfall crash in the forest, or just look up at a sky that isn't polluted to hell with light.	1
I am experiencing a wonderful relationship. I am being filled with light and love and I truly feel as though I‚Äôve hit the jack pot. But, for some reason, my depression is working hard to make sure to hide my own happiness from me.	1
I don't know if it's worth holding it or living anymore, i'm not suicidal but i need to fucking vent, 'cause i'm fucking going crazy, i cant fucking sleep at night, and when i do, i feel fucking sad the whole fucking day.	1
Based on looking at objective measures, I should be feeling pretty content right now, but I can't seem to be happy about it, and only about the things that I hope I'll work towards in the future.	1
So I'm trying my best (how ironic) to just feed myself everyday, and not letting my emotions burden the ones I love (or any person I come across). Basically just existing plainly.	1
Next week would be the last week in training, after that we‚Äôre going to get split up into teams and do actual work, but still go back to class to share our experience and reflect upon them. One could only hope for a miracle that I gain the strength and courage to talk to her more and be a part of her life. I really hate this feeling, yet this pain fuels my passion even more.The moment of clarity I've had suicidal ideations for as long as I can remember. Despite this, I always wrote off my depression as not being a problem. Throughout my entire lifetime, my thoughts have been so warped that I just assumed that they are normal parts of the human experience. It sounds so stupid typing things out. The moment I realized that my mental illness was "real" was coming to the conclusion that well-adjusted people do not think about killing themselves on a regular basis.	1
Everything you thought you knew since that day (October 21st) has become unraveled within the last fourteen hours. It‚Äôs hard to find the words that can sum it all up in order to save some time and space within this letter. This letter is also not about those specific events but about you and only you, and how far you‚Äôve come; it all plays into being able to deal with whatever the future may bring.	1
What am I even saying? I am incredibly short fused, I feel like I'm slowly burning alive. I'm just angry all the time. So people don't want me around, because frankly I'm an asshole. I hate who/what I am and violently hate myself.	1
I dream, sometimes, but normally I don't dream. And that's when I'm the happiest. I just feel like I'm dead and have no problems.	1
Just because things are moving forward and good for now doesn‚Äôt make my feelings and inner turmoil go away !	1
My friends don't deserve to deal with me so I've isolated myself. They just enjoy shitposting and memeing, not a pathetic emo child who is literally incapable of being happy right now.	1
I guess what I'm trying to say with this post is, I'm not sure if I'm happy or not. It's the not knowing that bugs me. I know I'm better than I was a year ago, but I still feel lost, and I don't know where to go from here. Every day is just a haze that I trot through.	1
So how did I find out? I suddenly woke up to hear my dad shaking the entire bed again. This time, I was really unaware and asked my dad to shut up. Suddenly, my mum nagged at me slightly and I was so confused. My mum went to the washroom and started showering? Which was so odd and made no sense. And from the corner of my eye, I saw my dad wearing his underwear and pants! He slipped them on so easily I thought it might have been a daily practice for them. He zipped up his pants naturally and it came as an instant realisation to me that both of them were engaging in some indecent shit.	0
After the breakup I ended up getting sick and after a couple months couldn‚Äôt even bring myself to take care of myself. Small stuff like wearing my retainer and showering before 5pm was the hardest part of my day. I know that seems small but it plays into how I feel now.	1
I get to be sit mates with the liveliest girl in training, playful and have a contagious ‚Äôhappy‚Äô aura(?). There were also a few talks and laughs about work related stuff, but I didn‚Äôt really made efforts to start it, she was always the one that engages first (and that‚Äôs because she‚Äôs an extrovert and does this to everyone anyways). Being around her, hearing her voice, seeing her smile felt something, it felt like the flame that I lost 4 years ago came back. But, what made me fell the most is that she‚Äôs intelligent as well and speaks in English flawlessly (I live in a country outside US). I can also relate to her because she suffers from clinical depression and requires therapy sessions every now and then (everyone in training knows this anyways because she told the class from the get-go). I didn‚Äôt really asked her out for lunch or coffee, I really wanted to so I could get to know her better and be friends with her, be her guide in her darkest days, but my introversion and over thinking always gets the best of me.	1
I have spoken to people at my school about it, but it's the same thing every time. 'Oh you're struggling? We'll have a five minute conversation about your feelings and wait months to make sure you're not still sad'. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I stopped taking medication in July 2017 and haven't seen a doctor or therapist since. They didn't help, the medication I was on turned me into a god damn zombie and my therapist got exceptionally pissy at me for not telling the truth about my lack of improvement. I felt like I had to lie so I didn't waste their time and mine, I worry that's why I end up wearing a mask 90% of the time. Even around my family, who believe more in self-help then actually getting an actually decent therapist to try and help me. I'm ashamed to talk to them about it, no matter what anyone says, trust me when I say that they will NOT understand. I have been incredibly clear about it all and got mocked for it, some people just don't want to learn.	1
i only got out of bed today to pee and eat a sandwich (which i thoroughly enjoyed - the sandwich, not the pee... but maybe the pee a little bit too... not in a weird way tho - so it‚Äôs nice to know i can still enjoy things, even if i‚Äôve developed an unhealthy coping method with food and am going to get fatter and hate my body even more. but hey, at least it‚Äôs not drugs). which also reminds me that i need to do dishes... or i could just keep buying disposable dishes, so that i can let that pile up in the trash i desperately need to take out instead.	1
I loved him so much and I can‚Äôt believe after all this time together he is just going to ghost me and leave me without a final conversation. Him ignoring me is so awful and selfish and is mind-boggling to me. I went ahead and deleted his number and deleted him off social media.	1
Except I am.Went two months feeling all right now I‚Äôm in the pit again. I feel nothing. I wish I could escape this. Feeling nothing is worse then feeling pain. Realizations/habits I have. Anyone else? ‚Ä¢Talking for too long about something no one cares about. ‚Ä¢Oversharing my problems when people ask why I'm always upset. -Or a reluctance to talk about my problems to someone that actually cares because no one else does. ‚Ä¢Making unnecessary expensive purchases to temporarily pad my self esteem. ‚Ä¢Making radical changes to my appearance to seem in control of my life. ‚Ä¢Oversharing on social media (being too depressing). ‚Ä¢Waiting for someone to start a conversation with me or initiate a friendship rather than the other way around ‚Ä¢Feeling entitled to people's time and attention when I hardly give people mine. ‚Ä¢Either oversleeping or hardly sleeping at all.	1
Two things: the stories are most definitely true, and I don't want Blue to know that I know about her being a bad classmate. I overheard these stories from reliable people.	0
My point is I actually have no reason to be taking this opportunity. The only thing that really ran through my head was "I'll probably kick myself in the ass in the future for not taking this". Considering this is a job that'll eventually lead to a solid annual salary within essentially no time, and requires no degrees or fancy stuff, it was kinda hard to say no.	1
All I know is that I hate not being able to enjoy almost *anything*.	1
Edit 3: REALLY THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HUG COMMENTS AND PMs ;-;I find the word "crippling depression" very true. But I think it's also a vicious cycle. Anyone have ever done this? It's like you stay in bed or sit around because you feel depressed. And then your feet kind of go numb and it makes you feel worse. It's like a vicious cycle. We are supposed to be using our limbs. We are not statues.	1
I skipped the only job interview I ever got because I couldn't bring myself to give a crap that dayWhy does anyone care? Its not like my life can get any better it doesn't do no good talking to anybody either because I just end up turning them against me my best friend a guy that I look up to as a brother doesn't even want anything to do with me anymore. I'm just absolutely pathetic just absolutely pathetic even if I can't join back with them I would at least like to talk to them and help them out if I could if not then what's the point I know they're tired of seeing me post about them and I can't help it they're my friends whether they want to admit it or not and I care about them very much. :(I think I'm having a nervous breakdown I've struggled off and on for about 10 years with anxiety and depression. The latter half has been mostly on. Recently my psychiatrist changed my medication from Zoloft to Effexor because the Zoloft had pretty much plateaued and then started working less. I don't think the Effexor is having a very good effect on me. My depression has been worse than ever. On top of that I found out that my dog has bone cancer and likely won't live more than 8-12 months. She's only 6 and she has been my entire world since I adopted her and she has helped me through a lot of difficult times. Because of these things my moods have been very bad, and I had to leave work a few days ago and I haven't been back since, and I'm pretty sure they're going to fire me because I'm still new. Although the job was adding to my stress because they failed to tell me that we would be working mandatory overtime EVERY SINGLE DAY. I don't have much of a support system. My mom is pissed at me about work, and I'm living with my grandfather who just doesn't get it. I don't really have much in the way of friends which is I guess why I'm ranting on Reddit looking for some kind of support. I don't really know what to do. I'm going to call my psychiatrist Monday to set up an appointment and hopefully get off Effexor. I want to find a job that is less intense than this one, and less hours. Hopefully part time. I don't know I just need some support/advice/anything.Fuck Everything &amp; Everyone I decided to make a different account for this, because I need to get all of this off my chest. I hate myself and I hate my life. I feel trapped at an absolute dead end in my life, and I'm not even in my twenties yet. I might as well be, considering everything I have to do.	1
I have people who say ‚Äúyeah, I was depressed before,‚Äù and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwhat did you do‚Äù and they say it just went away. Seriously? You just woke up and it was fucking gone? Poof?	1
Anyway, I know I am not such a loss to the world. If anything, the vast majority of people in the world would be happy because they would not have to interact with me. I have nothing to offer anyone and my existence is just a waste and if I am not happy why should I even be here.	1
But that‚Äôs the past. Nostalgia is bullshit, but I have to indulge once in awhile just to feel something, I‚Äôm sure you remember that. Here‚Äôs to better times ahead, and a letter left unread. Sincerely, Your Old Best Friend I didn't expect there are people here so quick to judge and assume I made a post about how hard it is to date and find someone if you have depression. I mentioned how people with depression who have a significant other most likely have an easier time that those who don't. What I didn't imply was that I wanted that just for the sake of "curing" my depression.	1
So that's it, I hope you've enjoyed it, I'd reeeaaally appreciate any feedback on it, and I hope that you're having a great week!	1
It's the worst part about depression for me. Not being able to enjoy anything. I don't even look forward to coming home from work because it's not like I have anything to enjoy at home. It's all the same dullness. I'd probably work 12-14 hours a day seven days a week if I could because it wouldn't bother me at all, I'm not missing out on anything. Too bad they don't because they don't want to pay overtime for me of course.19 , M , feeling so lonely , anyone wanna talk? Existing hurts I always feel like I'm just trying to distract myself from life with anything I can- games, drugs, moving around- because sitting down and not being able to do anything, often something I do- just hurts. I hate how slow and irrevelent I am. I'm so held up by anxiety and indecision that it's hard to even typeWhen luck doesn't work in your favor, and neither does bad luck So many people die of accidents everyday. Those who don't deserve it, those who have happy nice lives that they want to live. Yet here I am, wanting to get hit by a bus everytime I cross the road but never do I am so fucking unbearably lonely I have no job, no friends. and nothing even close to an SO. I've never even been on a date. That's a pipe dream of course I wouldn't date someone as disgusting as me so why should anyone else in the first place. But I can't stop desperately wanting to be loved, to be touched. not even sexually necessarily tho that too, but just be held, kissed. Anyone, I don't give a fuck anymore boy or girl just someone anyone please It's never happened and it feels like it never will. I feel like I'm starving to death. I can't shake this need I've never really felt before and it's every damn minute. it's so damn funny though I shrink away from even the slightest of contact with another human, in the rare occasion I'm in public I bury myself in my phone and hope desperately no one acknowledges me. no one ever does but I'm always still afraid they will. how fucking pathetic, isn't it. add this to the list of things that make me wanna rip my skin openFor those on antidepressants, is it working? Alternatives to antidepressants? Okay so I‚Äôm going back to a psychiatrist next week for my depression. I‚Äôve been going since high school and over the years have had depressive thoughts, suicidal ideation, lack of motivation and interest, high anxiety, numbness, hopelessness, etc etc. recently it‚Äôs been coming back.	1
That‚Äôs the second..	1
And maybe I am crazy, I‚Äôm sure as hell different, but that doesn‚Äôt make me any less of a person. I‚Äôm proud of who I have become and now I know what the purpose of my life is, and I‚Äôm not going to stop chasing it.	1
I haven‚Äôt spoken out loud to another human, barring work hours, in 3 weeks. I received my last non work related text 2 weeks ago.	1
While I'm not perfect these days, I've been at a job I never would have dreamed of for the past two and half years and have gotten a promotion.	1
TLDR; My friend gave me an ultimatum to decide if I still want to be friends with her or not.If this doesn't work, I'm accepting applications for a new bestie! Lol! I am socially awkward and I find it so hard to get close to people? I have very few friends. Basically one good friend and a bunch of people that i started to become friends with but i haven't been able to get close to. I have no idea how to become close to people and make friends and I am getting more and more depressed by the day. It feels like no one likes me, and I have absolutely no idea if thats the depression talking or if thats the truth and I am depressed because i finally realized that. I am so confused and I don't know what to change and what is stopping me from becoming better friends with people. I don't know if I am an unlikable person or if I am just really awkward and that is what repels people. I don't know what kind of an answer I am looking for, but I just need something to give me hope, like for something i can change or do to give me confidence to talk to people. Thanks for any answers, anything helps. Brother rage attack my grandmother My brother is prone to rage attacks. Him and I had that classic "brother love" growing up. Anyways this isn't about me it's about my grandmother.	0
I just don't understand. This whole text here is just me rambling my thoughts in hopes that someone somewhere reading this could maybe help me. I know you shouldn't need someone else to complete you but... I feel so alone and empty and the few times I've ever felt truly happy is when I'm with a guy, whether he's using me or not. Idk it's led to me getting my heartbroken a bunch, I let so many guys use me too but I guess in a weird way I was also using them? I was never really in love with any of them except for 1 and was mostly in it because I loved the idea of a relationship. I don't like being alone and I fear I'll never find someone I truly love and who loves me, leading to me living my life full of sadness and regretWho even cares anymore I‚Äôve just learned to accept my thought and I realise things aren‚Äôt gonna get better.I have the same cycle every day just play video games mourn for death wish I had weed and listen to sad songs till the morning life has just become such a boring shit show. Even talking to random people has me fucked up cause i fuck things up tell me guys what‚Äôs the point of even living anymore I feel like I'm dead already. Nothing gives me joy anymore, but I'm perfectly able to feel every negative emotion that's there. I feel like I'm wasting everyone's time. Basically it doesn't matter whether I'm around or not because I don't get anything out of it. I can't enjoy shit anymore. I don't wanna exist anymore. I feel like dying would be the best solution for everyone. but last night, for the first time, I felt like I could end it myself. it was enough, my emotions pushed me to the thought of actually doing it. I'm not afraid, I'm kind of glad that maybe there will be an end to all of this, maybe I can overcome my extreme guilt and end it myself one day.I feel like nothing matters I made a post here almost a week ago (it got ignored, big fucking surprise, i was born to be ignored after all)	1
Stranger: and if i do end up like that im not sure how id be alive after	1
But seeing her be so happy without me has put me in a state of deep depression since. Even typing though his out is painful.	1
I just want to know when it‚Äôs gonna get better.Sunday: I'm going to get my life together starting today. Monday: yeah nvm This happens every weekend I feel really motivated on Sunday morning and as the day goes on I don't actually do anything productive and by Sunday  night/Monday I'm miserable again what gives?I want give up I'm 17 years old, I live in Brazil. So how could I explain my history? Well, I was born in 2000 and I never knew my real father. my mother worked a lot and I spent my day at school and in my grandma's house with my cousins what was very nice, I had a happy childhood. when I was 4 my mom meet a guy who was very nice and I had a huge connection with him, calling him of dad and that's stuff, so they married and I have had a little sister which I loved at the first time I saw her, everything was good. Then when I was 13 my parents got divorce, and me and my sister decided to stay with dad. I met some awesome friends, the best people I ever met, but we are sorting out.. Now dad is getting married again, my mom is pregnant and is a risc pregnancy, she can lose the baby and her life... And I have to study for exames If want to do a college (is very hard in Brazil) but I don't know what I want to do, and I don't want live in Brazil anymore, but I need money to travel, even if I won a scholarship... And I've got depression for 2 years now... Is hard to keep alive for me... My hands won't do what I want them to. I know I know I've ranted about not being able to do anything artistic a thousand times now, but this is different.	1
The only thing I look forward to in life at the moment is my night or two out with a friend a week. The holidays are going to be rough on my family, I know now that my ex girlfriend (who I still care for and would probably take back) has completely moved on from me, and the once promising prospect of a new job isn't nearly as likely as it used to be. And, school kind of got caught up in the shuffle, and I'm not where I wanted to be with that, either. I'm going to be out on my own come January, which might help, but right now I'm just dreading the next month. I feel like the things I care about are slipping further and further out of my control, and it's hard for me to deal with.	1
I made camp happen. It was ugly and bumpy and unorganized, but I made it happen. I took solace in the fact that the kids didn't seem to notice the flaws, but it didn't do a lot good for my relationships with the other volunteers.	1
You: no just wasn't for me	1
- One is where I was crying after having particularly bad and involuntary memories. Annoyed by my state and stressed by upcoming finals he asked me: When is this going to end? You‚Äôre always spinning the same old tales, you‚Äôre driving yourself insane.	1
Four months later, my grandfather died. We were close. The last time we talked he said "that's my sweetheart, that's my pride and joy." I sat with him in the hospital and watched Aubrey Hepburn. We promised to see each other again soon.	1
I also take daily:  Adderall 15mg XR, Percocet 40mg, 2700mg Gabapentin and naproxen 500mg.	1
I feel so lost and helpless, and I feel like I'm grasping at straws trying to figure out what's going on. I don't know if this could be depression or if it's just a case of him checking out of this relationship. If any of these signs are an indicator, please please please let me know what I can do. I feel especially on edge because he's leaving to go back to uni in a few days but I don't know when I'll be able to see him again.	1
I'm tired of working in restaurants. I'm tired of wearing a stupid hat my hair can barely fit under. I'm tired of repeating phrases I'm told to repeat. I'm tired of seeing the disgusting process of how people‚Äôs shitty food is prepared. I'm tired of cooking, something I enjoy, feeling soulless.	1
My mother also gave me the best advice i've ever recieved. She told me that I wasn't on this earth just to find a job and live the best way i could just by buying things, that it didn't matter if i didn't find a huge reason to live; just by being there i was already the reason for my mother and many others to live and be happy,  the same way she was for me. That even just by smiling at the guy at the supermarket i was already making him a bit happier even though it would only be a few seconds, and that should be enough.	1
Stranger: you caught me	1
And I always get real upset about that and doubt myself over it, like, am I doing a bad thing by trying to be nice? I know that's not true, I get sometimes people want to figure things out on their own, or I guess you don't like my attitude or blablabla, but, I dunno, you can't maybe acknowledge that I'm trying to do good?	1
I still feel joy and moods in life , like eating good food , cry from very sob movies , but at the end of the day there's always something , it isn't feeling the same like how i had felt my entire life . I think it might be because i have no dreams or passions like other folks in my life , but i was always like that and i was always fully content with it .	1
Even as I am writing this, I don‚Äôt know where to start or end. In my mind, it is such a mess. It doesn‚Äôt matter because you are well now. I have never seen someone work harder. You are radiant and beautiful and clever and sarcastic and so special I couldn‚Äôt tell you how much if I tried. I hope you will always appreciate the battles you have fought and won. I hope you always believe you are a success.	1
This year I started a new study, lifesciences. It started all fun for the first two months. Because we had the basics of chemistry, anatomy, algebra and physics. But in the beginning of november the second semester started and thus I had tests from the first semester. Failed them all. In the weeks leading to the tests I couldnt concentrate or motivate myself to do anything. I was just at my room doing absolutely nothing. 14 november was my birthday, turned 19. Everyone forgot it except my gf (for 2,5 years). Was a fun day and made me forget the test results and gave me a little hope. Today she told me she was seeing someone else for the last 3 months because I had too little time to see her, because I was always busy with school.	1
I loved you, I don‚Äôt think I do anymore, but I know I did. I thought about comparing how I felt about you with a bunch of shitty metaphors but let‚Äôs be honest, that isn‚Äôt our style. We‚Äôd probably laugh at how cheesy it was and how stupid this whole situation is and then we‚Äôd pull out our guitars and write a beautiful sad duet and I‚Äôd be out of tune while you hit every note perfectly. But you wouldn‚Äôt critique me, that‚Äôs just the way you are.	1
Your so called 'friends' abandon You, because your depression talk has gotten too dark.	1
I've tried reaching out a couple times to talk to someone about it but they really don't want anything to do with me. I don't blame them though, it's not their fault nor are they obligated in any way to be friends with me.	1
Stranger: id say just keep going, if things seem bad now just realize how many times youve reached a breaking point in your life, for whatever reason, and that youre still here lol	1
Now it‚Äòs just an obligation I have to do. Back then I never used to come late to my therapy sessions because I really looked forward to it.	1
And your emotions shutdown,	1
I have seen her go through almost four years of pretending she'll try. I've gotten so excited and so happy and so hopeful only to have it thrown in my face. I love her, but in all honesty, I don't want to keep waiting and watching for her to die. Because that's what the diagnosis has been for the past 6 months - change her life, or die from complications. But all she does is whine about being fat, and then ask me to order in pizza.	0
She would call me frequently just to sing her new hymns and I would challenge her to learn a new hymn every week, this routine went on for quite a while between ourselves...	1

I redoubled my efforts at the beginning of my 5th and final year of college. I moved into a house with some of the other volunteers who I was closest to. I had to quit my research, and I couldn't keep my grades where I wanted them, but camp planning was progressing well, especially after our national organization took notice of the lack of effort on my co-director's part and added a third director, my friend and newly minted roommate A.	1
Yes. I miss having the girl companion, having another girl to talk to about things. But, I don't want a friend that isn't a true friend. Who just dumps 7 years of friendship over feeling like a 3rd wheel. I think there was a jealousy element to it but I'll never know. Because I'm not chasing her, she's gotta come to me. I'm don't chasing her Unsure how to talk to friend about something they're doing, or well, not doing. [Advice] First time poster in need of a bit of advice. Sorry this'll be long.	0
I was so embarrassed that she did this to me, I felt betrayed and hurt that she made me the schools problem instead of hers. It hurt ne so bad. I was embarrassed that the school knew, I was embarrassed that my parents knew now. I wanted to kill myself more than ever now. I was so hurt by this and was angry at Cindy. I went home and tried stabbing myself. My mom went in my room to talk to me, just so happened at that moment I had a kitchen knife in my hand to stab myself. My mon fought me over it and sent me to a psychiatric hospital. I stayed there until December 23rd. At the hospital I tried killing myself twice. First time was when the guards/residents give you cracks, I ate the crackers but stuffed the wrapper down my throat. One if the residents heard me making choking nosies and came in to save me. Second time was when I started swallowing my food instead of chewing on it to choke me out again. They put me on these medications that didn't help but I acted like they did so I can go home. I was alone again, Cindy stopped talking to me. It broke my heart and broke me.	1
It has been too long though. I can't seem to find another job. I can't even bring myself to apply anymore. I don't have a car. I "rent" a couple rooms off the main house of my inlaws. I failed so hard in giving my wife a life worth living. She spends her time working and though understands and doesn't mind my unemployment it is killing me.	1

I live and work on the road at the moment travelling from town to town so ive dropped the gym membership but I try and make up for it with doing workout sessions on my own, lots of hiking and swimming. I recently switched to a keto diet from the previous meal plan I was on. I am fitter than I have ever been and what I can achieve now in a physical capacity is so much greater than ever before in my life (I was less fit even as a child) The problem I have is that im still so overweight, I very rarely find anything that fits me in stores and i dont have an address to order things online. I feel like people could look at me and assume I dont give a fuck about my health when I do and that makes me feel worse. Anytime I talk to doctors about unrelated issues they make it about my weight. I feel like outwardly im the worst version of myself, I look in the mirror and get angry. Does anyone have any tips on how to pull myself out of this? I feel so crushed when I'm reminded of my weight because I dont feel how I look. I want to be proud of my achievements but I'm not, I feel annoyed that its not better and I havent reached a bigger goal. I think ill never reach a weight I'm happy with - which is not only devastating to me but bothers me so much more because im genuinely trying my hardest. Ive had hiccups and times where I've literally tried to eat my feelings away but I always pick myself up and try again. I dont know how many more times I can fail.	1
Cheering you on!! ~austen1996	1
Instead my psychiatrist described me brintellix (Vortioxetine), 10 mg per day for my depression.	1
And it dawns on me that I'll get another chance. I may have fucked things up this time but I've bounced back from fuckups before by just acting natural so I'm probably going to do so again. There will be more chances to treat people the way I want to be treated no matter what age I get to. I don't need someone to be nice to me, all I have ever needed in life is just to be nice to other people.	1
What should I do to be able to get closer to my dad?Will my best friend come back because of this reason? In about April my best friend cut me off from her life, we were friends for nearly 7 months and we were so close, had a really strong bond, and the only time we wouldn't talk to eachother whether it'd be facetime, messenger or call as well as trying to see eachother as often as possible, was when we would sleep. Otherwise, we were always talking to eachother and we cared for and loved eachother a great deal and did heaps for eachother but yeh she did in fact cut me off because I didn't reply to her messages one day. Anyway we haven't communicated at all since then but I sent her a letter for this year 12 camp we did so it's a graduation letter dedicated to her. I told her I would send it to her when we were friends and I'm not sure if she's forgotten but it is going to be sent to her. The contents of it go along the lines of thanking her, stating how much I appreciate her and that I'll always be there for her no matter the situation in 1 1/2 pages. I'm not 100% but could this possibly bring me and her back to being friends again?Friends That Can‚Äôt Be Wrong? So basically; my friend always thinks that I‚Äôm mad when I‚Äôm not. In turn, he gets mad at me because I‚Äôm ‚Äúmad‚Äù. I try to explain as calmly as possible that I‚Äôm not mad, which makes him even more mad.	0
Currently, I have been working my butt off to be able to join the military to get away from my parents. My depression is acting up so much, it‚Äôs getting really hard to keep trying. I often find myself daydreaming and pondering how good/easy it would feel/be to just stop what I‚Äôm doing and give up. Get in bed, stay in bed, go eat, eat some more, and more, finally not caring about my appearance and just not doing anything in general. I‚Äôm drunk and lonely, and and my family is worried about me. They are so loving. But I can‚Äôt connect with them. I have a kinda-sorta girlfriend. She is very nice, but we get doubts about each other. I have a good job, but I don‚Äôt perform well in it. I drink multiple times every week. It‚Äôs usually not such strong drink, but yet it is bad. I have paid for sex in the past (didn‚Äôt work). I‚Äôm somebody who is so inspired but so tired of constant deafening nature of life. I‚Äôm tired. I am hurting or disappointing everyone. What should I do?Help me out here. Please. How THE FUCK are you suppost to fix your insomnia while suffering from a pretty severe depressive episode. My head is going to goddamn explode from this shit.Anyone else just drive? Idk, just like exploring places and stuff while listening to music. Can be kinda funIn a bad headspace after a breakup with someone who finally made me feel like things would be okay It‚Äôs been a week since I returned from a six month exchange program overseas. There, I ended a 2y relationship with an addict, who I still cared for but could not love anymore. Then, of course, I fell in love with someone. We were inseparable for the six months. As I struggle with depression, anxiety and schizoaffective disorder, it hasn‚Äôt been the easiest for him.	1
Stranger: well	1
My ‚Äûnew‚Äú therapist asked me what I can bear more. My suicidal state or this passive suicidal state. I told her the last one. But honestly, I want it to be the first one.	1
And since I don't have any friends to talk to, I have to bother you nice people with this. Sorry you had to read this far, just continue scrolling now. Needed to get it off my chestRecently single due to my depression and i don‚Äôt know how to feel. I‚Äôve had depression a majority of my life, it comes and goes a lot, but as of recently it‚Äôs really hit hard. I‚Äôve lost all motivation to finish college and live life outside of my house. I was dating somebody for a year and half, until my depression started to affect our relationship, she couldn‚Äôt handle the pressure of it all. It‚Äôs been three weeks since the break up and my emotions are all out of wack. One minute I‚Äôm crying for my ex and the next I‚Äôm spacing out, looking at the ceiling. I honestly don‚Äôt know how to feel and how to cope. I'm afraid to be in a relationship I say this because every guy who has asked me out. I just say no. I just panic and say no but I become friends with them. Then when our friendship ends because I ruined it. I feel so alone and depressed for days. Just from me writing this. It shows I'm not fit to be in a relationship with anyone or my depression will make me feel like I'm in so much pain. Then I also hate being alone like it would just be nice for one day to be hugged all day by a guy. I would feel more relaxed and just forget about so many things. How do you get up and out of bed in the morning? I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit but I don't really know where to post for motivational tips or tricks.	1
Random articles are usually unhelpful. They all say get healthier, socialize, be productive, see a therapist, and/or get medication.	1
I am a fake person At work I am a Happy person who makes jokes and makes people laugh everyone says they like me	1
My second problem is that I have a well paying job but it is very stressful and demanding. It takes up the majority of my day and this stress feeds into my poor eating habits. I have considered quitting but I cannot justify saying no to the money. I am scared that if I quit to try to focus on myself, I will just eat more and more because I will be less busy.	1
On a positive note , good thing is i don't have any suicidal thoughts .Getting motivated to get help I was diagnosed with a mood disorder and PTSD ~1.5 years ago. I was getting help for a while but I dropped out of school and moved out of state so I just haven't been able to do that in the past year. I live with (and mooch off of) an SO but I've been fairly isolated for about 6 months. I've been doing online school but had to drop my classes this semester when I started working. Now all I do is this stupid part-time job. I should probably quit because it makes me incredibly suicidal. It's all so superficial. It doesn't feel beneath me but I really just don't mesh with it.	1
Stranger: also do you live alone?	1
Forever single due to my weird nature and orientation.	1
She had a choice to get rid of me and choose not to thinking something good might come of this. My very existence not only ruined her life but gave myself no future or desire to live in the first place. So why am I still here? I just want it to end. I just want to see her one more time and then let it all end.I think i might be depressed , even when i'm having an ok life , is it possible? I'll try to keep this as short as possible , no one likes a wall of text .	1
As someone who has never suffered depression (Ive been "depressed" but that was from external factors like a job not working out or a girl leaving me. I consider that normal human emotion), how do I identify Marines under my care thst may be suffering and need help.	1
Some days I function fine and everything seems "normal", other days everything feels foreign. Sometimes I can do whatever and it just feels like any other day. On other days, I'm freaking the fuck out. It feels like I don't know how to do anything because everything seems so unfamiliar. From walking down the road to the grocery store to brushing my teeth. It's funny now when I think about it because it's all so easy :DI've always resented my mom for being emotionally abusive growing up and blamed her for my depression. But I just told her I'm depressed and she responded in the most perfect way. I feel really weird. I'm an adult now (24) and have had crippling depression since childhood. Growing up, I never had emotional support or love. I was called names and my mom took out her relationship/life issues on me. I was distant from both my parents. I've hugged my mom only once in my life. This is just one issue out of many that led to me developing a fragile self esteem and crippling depression. Over the years, with distance, we started to talk- like once a month or so. The more educated I became, the more I came to understand why she acted the way she did (although I still harbor much resentment) I'm going through a depressive episode just now. I feel so alone and I texted her out of desperation. I told her I felt alone and depressed and couldn't get out of bed to study. Instead of judging me or saying something mean....she just listened to everything and all of my symptoms. She said that she felt so sorry for me and she wished she could help me. And she told me to never feel alone because she loves me and I'm very important to her. She asked if she could do anything to help me...and I realized, yeah, if we could call each other every morning, I could have someone to talk to and tell her about my daily goals. Then I could feel more motivated to get out of bed and feel less alone that day. I just feel weird, because I don't have a relationship with her. I'm scared it's going to be awkward, but I'm desperate for any support I can get right now. I also still resent her, but at the same time understand. I don't know. It's just weird. But, I'm happy she acted this way, for sure. Edit: I also don't mean to brag or anything like that. I just wanted to share this with someone, and was wondering if someone had a similar experience maybe in forming a bond with their parents longer into adulthood."I used to be you" "It gets better" "You have to love yourself first" &amp; other lies Not even sure if I should post in this sub, but..	1
A helped enormously, but I still had so much on my plate. To cope with the stress, my drug use started to skyrocket. I was smoking weed and cigarettes all the time, and to keep up with all my biochemistry coursework and 8-10 planning meetings a week I was taking my prescribed adderall more often than I should have been. I became thoroughly addicted. In my final quarter of school, everything really fell apart.	1
So what‚Äôs my situation now? Jobless, girls still despise me, have a degree with which I can‚Äôt find a job with and all the work I put into improving my situation was for nothing.	1
Oh yeah, she also kicked my head to wake me up. That's a thing.Addicted to escapism If I am not occupying myself with any form of entertainment (games, books, movies, music, drawing, writing, etc.) I feel depression and anxiety. Whatever I do in real life, there is a heavy stone in my chest, if you know that feeling. I cannot escape sadness, boredom and loneliness whatever I do. I only feel really good when I sleep and have wonderful dreams. Today I looked in the mirror and thought to myself for the first time "that's a beautiful person" Then I played xbox 6 hours non stop and looked in the mirror and thought "who am I" I need to stop a lot of habits if I want to get rid of my depression.I haven't touched another person in 4 years. I know it sound weird and creepy but i don't mean it like that. I mean hugs. I just want a hug. That's it. I don't have anyone to really love and i just feel so tense and alone. Want to read my texts about depression? In past few days I've been writing little texts about my feelings and depression ro help me get the bad feelings out of my mind.. I was wondering if my you guys were interested in reading them?Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop pls..Does anyone feel like no one has any nice things to say about you? I hear everyone say nice things about other people. I wish someone would call me fun, energetic, smart, cute. I swear I never hear it.Nightmares and dreams HI, I don't know about you, but when I was a kid I used to have this weird nightmares (not the teeth fell out usual nightmares) Like getting lost in a winter forest in pijamas just to be eaten up by wolves, being totally awake at my bed while insects ate me alive ( like sleep paralysis but dreaming?) or just watching my mother being eaten by feral dogs as she protected me.	1
Can't control my own pet dog, in too much trouble.	1

I don't know how to cope with any of this and I'm just going to stop trying to. If it happens, it happens. No big deal in the grand scheme of things.What‚Äôs the point of coming up if you‚Äôre gonna go down? I moved to a new city with the love of my life after 5 years of loving him. I was ready to propose, I looked at rings, I called jewelers. I debated getting a ring of meteorite, you know? He‚Äôs super nerdy, super cute. Science geek and all. I‚Äôd like to think every guy buying rings thinks about the meteorite ring haha.	1
Fast forward to this morning. I'm in the shower and start thinking of my day to come, making mental to-do lists, and stressing about my current temporary problems. But somewhere along the line, I start thinking of the stupid story. I can't help but start comparing my  life with that of the main character and think about how much I'd give just to be able to live a more meaningful, less real life. Then I start comparing myself to the character, and realize just how _useless_ I am. Like holy shit, I'm almost an adult and am still a passionless idiot who does nothing outside of schoolwork. Of course I can't lead a meaningful life, I'm not worthy of any of it. Thinking about this evidently stressed me out a bit too much, as I started puking what little I ate all over my shower floor and crying.	1
I completly stopped and now I feel numb again. I want to feel suicidal and emotional again, to be honest. At least I processed something. Now I feel empty and dead inside once again, like how I used to be all the years before I started therapy and taking anti depressants.	1
etc etc etcBirthdays are the hardest time for me Every year relatives call me and every year same old convo. Anyone special in your life? Any closer to getting married. And I know it stupid but it kills me every time. Because I'm not and every year I reflect on spending another year of existence alone and only have another year of loneliness to look forward to. I've tried to immerse myself in hobbies like movies. Focus all my energy on school or working out but I guess some voids are too large to fill.I need help Please help, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening and I can‚Äôt control my emotions. I‚Äôm losing it.	1
Sometimes I wonder if those that commit suicide do so because it's either a) the only perceived way out of their grief or b) that it effectively proves to others beyond a shadow of a doubt what kind of hell they had been living through in the years leading up to doing it.	1
Oh well. Thanks for listening. This beautiful weather is making me 100x more depressed than I already am. I suffer from crippling depression, lack of confidence and no self esteem so it‚Äôs not like I can go out and about and meet people just like that. I‚Äôm craving human interaction but I don‚Äôt know where to start about gaining back those qualities. It‚Äôs so nice out I just wanna go hang out with someone and shoot the shit, take pictures of whatever, get dinner and drinks, do outdoorsy things, skate, anything but all I‚Äôm gonna do is go home and mope and cry about how shitty my life continues to be. Just cut off all of my friends and I‚Äôm feeling alone and regretful Posted this to r/advice but I think that wasn‚Äôt the right place for it.	1
It's hard for me to stomach.	1
My wife and I are supported by an excellent scholarship, and we don't have to worry a lot about money or health insurance so, on the financial field, we are kinda covered. But being here makes me feel powerless. Obviously, I don't have my good friends here with me, and I feel much less "special" as a person. I feel like I am only one among millions who are trying to survive in this big hectic city. In the beginning, I thought it is beautiful that this city is full of people from all around the world, but now it just feels to me that everyone are strangers to each other and it seems like it is the loneliest city in the world at the moment.	1

Even something as simple as having to raid on WoW, my anxiety is horrible with dealing currently and I constantly stress out about people finding out that I'm unhappy because I don't want anyone to see me like this. It's pathetic. It's the only 'social' thing I do anymore and I don't even want to do that. Playing a videogame is too stressful. P a t h e t i c.	1

We eventually went to the same university together and some of her closest friends became great friends of mine. We took a class together. Would exercise together.

But now, she is living her life.  She is out drinking, smoking, doing drugs and sleeping with anything she can get her claws into. She has restarted her YouTube "career", and quite frankly, they're boring videos.	1
I'm not completely not trying. I'll take St. John's Wort if I'm persistently suicidal but it doesn't help with motivation. I've been going to support groups. I'll "decide" to be motivated but end up collapsed and sobbing before I get out of the door. Play music, leave my phone behind so I don't get sidetracked. Tell people what I'm doing so I feel pressured to keep my word. Incentivize with promises of fast food, caffeine, or chocolate. I dunno what else to do. I can't even tell if it's laziness or depression or something else. The only thing that motivates me to go to work is fear which is also the main thing that prevents me from quitting.I wish someone would just kill me I can't do this anymore, and I'm too scared to do it myself.Try to stop identifying with your thoughts Dude, I know how it is to be depressed. I know how it is to be sick and tired of being sick and tired. Tired of the hate, tired of being tired of the hate, tired of being tried of being affected by the hate.	1
She is so busy playing video games right now, the only one that really has helped me this past week is  her husband.	1
It really hurts me that he does this, because he knows I have bad mental health, but he only makes me feel worse about it by making me feel worse about myself. This has been happening for the past three months, and I've had so many urges to tell him that we can't be friends anymore because he's hurting me so much.	1
And again: Sometimes, it is not simply not about you.	1
But how? I've tried arts, sports, entertainment, pretty much everything, and nothing really spark an interest, even when I try to get into it for like 2 weeks to a month (after that I don't even want to do it at all).	1
I'm just... Tired. And I feel like a bitch because of it. I go to school, work on some homework, go to work, procrastinate homework to get some damn relaxation time, rinse, repeat.	1
My life has been so hard lately, my mom lost her kids in court, other then that, my stepdad made an false accusation of me doing stuff to a child becasuse he is a fucking moron and wanted to ruin my life for fun. (And no, i didnt do anything to a kid just FYI). I won the case but it was ever lasting 3 years..	1

Hi everyone. I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong. This is my first time visiting this subreddit, and so I don't know what's generally expected or done on here. Let me just get into this.	1
Today though I decided to go to subway to get a melt and I was just standing in line when this girl walks away from her friend and up to me. I thought she was pretty and was nervous about why she was talking to me until she asked ‚ÄúAre you a serial killer?‚Äù  That‚Äôs when my heart sank.	1
TL;DR	1
I've done quite a bit of thinking by myself,  and have talked to a bunch of people from back in the psychiatric ward on what 'fixes' us. And the unfortunate answer for most of us is... Nothing. We can't be fixed. It's just how our minds work. But what if we don't have to be fixed? The hardest part about depression for me, is the intensity of the loneliness I feel. When I'm at my worst, I'm so focused on my own loneliness and the meaninglessness of my relationships, that the few connections I do have, I dismiss. Now, this isn't the case for all people suffering from depression. For a lot of people, their negative emotions are driven by a sense of worthlessness,  meaninglessness or sadness.	1
I've been to several therapists. I've been rationing my pills 1 every 2 days, and my mother and fianc√©e who I live with have already seen a drastic change in my behavior. I feel awful because they give me such a nice and comfortable life but I am still depressed. I don't know what to do when I have no more antidepressants after 5+ years and then going cold Turkey. I'm afraid my brain chemistry will convince me to do something stupid and damaging to myself again.Everything's just been hard to deal with lately... I don't really know how to start this, since I'm kind of new to this subreddit, and reddit in general, but I guess I'll try to say this all without embarrassing myself or something of the sort. Lately, I've just been having a tough time, especially since it's the last week before exams in my school. I don't feel any pressure to be doing well at studies anymore, but I do have one friend who *does,* and occasionally, he'll ask for space or something during stressful times so that he doesn't end up lashing out at me, but now, it's just making me feel incredibly lonely. I hate having to watch everyone else give hugs and stuff and just have a good time with their friends while I just keep having to give my friend space. I get that we put this in place to avoid having feelings hurt, but now it just feels... restrictive? It's all kind of hard to describe coherently, and my mind feels all jumbled up, tbh. I just really want a hug at this point so i can stop feeling... well, lonely...Just ranting. It fucking annoys me when I tell someone I‚Äôm depressed and they say ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù Like, when someone tells you they have the fucking flu do you ask why? How are people so dumb about mental illness?	1
My whole life i have felt lonely, sometimes with a good reason, sometimes really without a reason. I have dealt with "depression" (not officially diagnosed), or atleast felt like i was. To be completelty honest. I feel like a sad little fucking sack of shit. What have i achieved in my life? Fucking nothing. I cant even think like a fucking normal person, people think im weird, i dont have logical sense. Everyday i have to force myself out of bed. Its been like this for so long now that im starting to get used to it. Even now that i dont have a job until feb, i simply dont have the strength to get out of bed. I sleep 12 hrs per day just so the day passes by faster.	1
This recent one, and the one that called me with suicidal thoughts, have made me want to be much more aware of the mental health of those around me. The scary thing to me is, even with hindsight, i wouldn't have picked these five guys out of the lot as having ANY kind of issues, let alone suicidal tendencies.	1
I don't understand why I'm not better, or what else I can do outside of medication. I run, I work hard and do well at work, I am a dedicated father and spend lots of time with the kids, I'm dedicated to making sure they feel loved and cared for, their needs are ahead of my own.	1
Thanks.I think about multiple ways of killing myself everyday but I can't bring myself to do it. I'm so done feeling so so alone. I have friends who I can talk to, but I feel like I'm burdening them everytime. I'm pretty much done with my life. my studies are going nowhere, and I have no motivation in life.	1
look, my dude... i haven‚Äôt showered in a week, and although i bleached my hair so you can‚Äôt see how dirty it is when that happens, i can still feel it and would really like to use that coconut shampoo i bought that makes me smell like, well, coconuts. i‚Äôm not sure what i smell like right now, but it‚Äôs probably not fruit. maybe that lavender febreze i spray all the time, if i‚Äôm lucky.	1
Depression is a fucking bitch, and even now, when I actually feel happy and loved and excited for my future, I‚Äôm not naive enough to think that I‚Äôll never have to struggle with my mental health again. But I think I have learned how to best cope with it. Medication didn‚Äôt work for me, and while I do believe that professional therapy can be invaluable to people struggling with mental illness, it didn‚Äôt make a big difference in my case. But I learned to focus on the present, to rely on loved ones I‚Äôm lucky enough to have, and to forgive myself. Take it one small step at a time. So what if you couldn‚Äôt leave your room today? That shit‚Äôs fucking hard! You got up and you got out of bed, that‚Äôs the first step. Learn to love yourself even through the despair and self-loathing.	1
My friend understood everything of course. More than just being my partner in work, she was the only person who could tell when things got really bad for me. When i hide how miserable i am, she's the first person to notice, and the only person who understands and will tell me what i need to hear. If there is any upside to all of this, it's that at least i still have my friend. In my overthinking and fear, i guess i was afraid this would change things. I learned pretty fast how much care and respect she holds for me, and i don't think anything will change that. I hope not.	1
I started seeing a therapist, I started taking anti depressants, I exercised for awhile, I tried meditating, I feel like I‚Äôm trying everting in my power to get me mind right. But my brain is mush and now I can‚Äôt be successful in anything I do. School is starting to slip and my friends keep asking why they never see me.	1
This girl was my best friend and my first serious relationship. I met her when I first got depressed, and we went to the same church together.	1
I've always hated myself but I was too naive to know what it was and I thought it was normal. Why can't I be normal?	1
I guess I can be happy that I‚Äôve started to make changes. They say change your habits and your mind will follow. Well I‚Äôve improved my habits greatly over the past year, so why am I still a piece of shit. Why am I still unable to let go of the failed relationships. Why am I unable to move forward from all this. do naps trigger depression? can someone relate to this? like most of the time i go take a nap, ESPECIALLY in a sunny day, esp when the sun is setting and i wake up after and hour or two, i feel so lost and the loneliness is reinforced like 10 times. i feel like ive missed out on life and feel more of a failure by just sleeping. like ive wasted time. and the most depressing part is having no one to go enjoy the sunset with, or go out or do anything. its ugh I ruined all four of my friendships in one stupid move Fucking siblings. Every only child thinks they want one. Everyone with a sibling is annoyed by them, but secretly loves them. Not me. My brother makes me want to kill myself. He's one of the two reasons I'm as fucked up as I am today. And he knows that. That's why he does it. Well, one day, he was being nice to me. It was a less depressing time for me. I was bored. Thought, ya know, why not add my brother to the group chat. Big. Fucking. Mistake. He took the pettiness level through the roof and convinced my friends everything I ever do is a fucking lie. He convinced my friends I'm an asshole who does nothing but pick at him and make up problems all day. I have no friends now I feel so betrayed. Alone. I don't really care about that though. I've realized I'll never be happy. Not while he lives. Any chance I have at happiness he can rip away from me just as easily. What the fuck is the point in living??? I don't think I can do this much longer.Do you feel the same? After seeing many of my classmates being successful in their lifes, I felt terrible‚Ä¶ the trouble inside me just rooted even deeper. I don‚Äôt feel productive as I should be. I feel like I just want to sleep forever, not having to care about anything. I texted so many people that says to text them when I need them, but none of them replied. Maybe it is because of me who scared them away? Maybe it is because I‚Äôm an introvert who hates interacting with people? I just want someone who really cares about me, who will cheer me up when I‚Äôm sad. Right now, I‚Äôm just wondering why they have lifes that are so easy when compared to me? I have problem both physically and emotionally. I have been in the situation caused trauma and still haunt me every night. I‚Äôm jealous of them. Not having any emotional pains, can someone just tell me something that will give me hope to live on? We all probably need it.	1
The only thing I do with my life is listen to Joy of Mans Desiring in bed, contemplating my existence.It‚Äôs just grey Everyone around me treats me like dirt. I‚Äôm my friends personal punching bag, my parents hate me, the love of my life essentially uses me... everything seems so bleak all the time. Like just an endless void of hurting and I have no idea what to do or who to turn to. I had friends that would try to help me but idk if they just got sick of me not getting any better or if I was a bad friend or what... I‚Äôm only 17 but I‚Äôve felt this meaninglessness since I was eight. It‚Äôs one of the few things I even remember from back then. I‚Äôm very strongly Christian but even then I feel like God made me on accident. Like my entire existence is a mistake. I don‚Äôt know what to do.Depression, I'm so fucking sick of you. Whatever I do, whatever I achieve- You won't let go of me.	1
Stranger: do you try new things?	1
You: i can easily see myself living on the street haha	1
I spent years ashamed of the person I was because I was scared to show people my true, raw, fucked up self. But isn‚Äôt that the problem? When it comes to having a mental illness, we believe the stigmas that come attached to it and we‚Äôre afraid to speak up and talk about it. And the people who are lucky enough to not experience it, don‚Äôt want to talk about it either. The only difference from how mental illness was treated a hundred years ago and now, is that we no longer hide and chain our family members in basements or attics, but the shame and embarrassment is still there.	1
I'm going to try and draw, spend time with my Service Parrot and submerge myself in my gaming community. To keep myself as positively distracted as I can.	1
and since i wont have internet for a while,  im getting bored out of my mind, and my depression is hitting me so hard..	1
Basically a thing happened in July, which caused me to have constant panic attacks and overall brutal anxiety until around October, when I just transitioned into deep depression. It was however a big relief. I was completely empty, I didn't care about anything. It was 100x better to me than fucking anxiety. When I'm depressed, I don't feel 'bad'. I don't feel good either, but I'm fine with that. I don't feel anything, it's kinda relaxing.	1
I've been admitted to a mental hospital by my mother after I got raped and beaten, because I drank a lot of alcohol for a few days.	1

I'm happy with the way things are, us spending lots of time together, hanging out at each other's houses for hours, trying different foods, and just having someone like her I can talk to.	1
I'll be short, not the best writer. I am university student, 25, about to get bachelors degree in programming. Never had a job , leeching from mom. After four years of study i realized that at best i am average, at worst i am below that. Before going to psychiatrist(spelling?), decided to "look around" and see  if there is basis for it or not.	1
I really don't know what to do I'm lost and reaching the end of my patience, I'm thinking of doing it I have methods but just need something to instigate it....Anyone ever wish they were good at something? Something. Anything. Be it something innocuous or something that can get you a kickass job. Anything from which you could derive happiness and fulfillment. I've failed at everything I've tried. Good at absolutely nothing, even after years of trying. If there were even one such thing, I could just devote myself to it and use it to keep myself busy.Functional depression?? Is anyone here in a similar boat? I have a bachelor degree, girlfriend, am athletic although exercise on and off. Having trouble finding a stable career but i‚Äôm optimistic. Tried getting a masters degree but it‚Äôs not working out so far. Anyways what i‚Äôm trying to say is that on paper my life seems ok, but i‚Äôve tried a few therapists, medications and nothing is getting me out of this hole of low mood, motivation, and occasional thoughts. I still skip meals, eat junk, sleep inconsistently, have days where i‚Äôm ready to quit everything. I do have little people to talk to and feel connected with even though i have parents, and some friends. It‚Äôs been several years now like this. Does it get better? That‚Äôs what people say, am i missing something? Am i overthinking everything? Anyways thanks for reading.School Just being here makes me even more depressed and suicidal then I normally am at home. Why am I so fucking tired all the time? Everyday is so monotonous and I have trouble doing the simplest things. Everyone says it's going to get better, but I'm just getting more and more tired of all of this. Just got kicked again from a whatsapp group I only asked a question, they always removed me without saying anythingStruggled with depression and anxiety for 3 years and made it through Hi everyone, I just wanted to share my experiences with depression and anxiety in the hope it might give someone else a reason to keep going.

We can‚Äôt go about one day without him saying he doesn‚Äôt feel good. It‚Äôs hard to enjoy myself whenever we go out because I‚Äôm just waiting for him to say something about not feeling good so we can just leave wherever we‚Äôre at.	1
There were only a few times she joined me and my friend during a coffee break where I found out a few things about her. There were times that I see the sadness beyond her smile, and times where her depression was clearly visible and affected me greatly. I always think about scenarios - if the conditions were right - where I get to talk with her and lend a helping hand, at the end of the day they only remain as thoughts. I know she doesn‚Äôt think about me like how I think about her. Every time our shift ends, I leave the office quickly and ignore the feelings I have for her, my mind is at a constant battle on whether or not to ask her for lunch, ask her if she‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs even worse at night, whenever I see her late night tweets about her depression, a part of me just wants to be there for her, and the other part gives me the realization of how pathetic I am and that I don‚Äôt deserve her. I know that she had an ex-bf that broke her heart, and currently has a gf (she‚Äôs bi). Yet, she still gives me inspiration in every photo I take. I really don‚Äôt know what is wrong with me, I‚Äôm being tormented by my own mind and I still like it. Knowing that she already has someone in her heart, yet still seeing her depressed at times (and looking at her tweets), really makes me want to step up and do something, but held back by my own tormented soul.	1
I've been complaining about feeling depressed and suicidal, because it's true, and it became a way to relate to the world, which makes people leave. The spiral is getting tighter, and it feels like a black hole is pulling me in. I can't imagine facing another divorce feeling this low.	1
I really wished I could show affection to those I love and care about. But I realise that without any qualities as a person, I'm better off just not being a nuisance and a liability.	1
-&gt; Lay down, and now...	1
I've spent the 5 months since then trying to find a job. 50+ apps out and I'm no closer than when I started. I've been up to visit the city I graduated in twice, but both times I've been wracked with crippling anxiety. I can tell how A affected the opinions of some of my closest friends, and it kills me.	1
Perhaps my wording was not good enough, but still, such a judgemental approach to answering someone's post on a depression subreddit is in my opinion very saddening. Just wanted to share this now, take it as you will. Intense feelings of not wanting to exist/ wanting to escape and be alone somewhere forever I'm a first year in university and have suffered from depression since middle school. I've been able to manage my depression by having really supportive friends and through that, felt like I had a purpose in life. However now entering university, I feel like I have no purpose, no reason to exist and it is a lot harder managing my depression. I fill up my time with work and sports and stuff as a way to distract myself, but I just feel like I am going through the motions of life and everything just feels hallow. I think dying is such a pleasant and peaceful idea and am totally okay with it. I feel like I don't have any actual friends even though I go out a lot, and I feel like I have no impact on other people's lives, like they can go on so easily without me being there.	1
Not asking for advice as such, just interested to hear if any of you guys are depressed even though your lives are good on paper. Addicted to depression Every time when I feel like the self-loathing and depressive feelings are becoming less, I feel shit because I don't feel depressed anymore. It's so weird because I want it to go away but some part of me wants to stay depressive and feel suicidal.God "God moves towards those who need him the most and those who are emotionally broken" Really ? Well where the fuck has he been for the past three years in my life? I am tired of asking God to make me feel less depressed and never getting an answer. I guess he doesn't give a shit about me, but that's okay, because now I don't give a shit about him either. I can't fucking handle this life How do people do it? I'm supposed to be happy, because I live in Norway, one of the best places to live. How the fuck can I? The thought of all those innocent people murdered just so that the westerners can live comfortably, it just makes me sick. There's no logic to any of this, I'm born into an uncaring and cold world, forced to work my ass of 9-5 every day, just so some corporate asshole can get more money. I earn a fraction of that amount, and then I have to pay some of that to the government. The government then tries to keep me "safe", by threatening me with involuntary commitment. They're just trying to keep their livestock in check. We're all just slaves, and no one else seems to understand that. There's this weight on my shoulders, this expectation for me to be something. I can't fucking understand how everyone is okay with this. I want out.I'm sad I feel sad.  At least I feel something. Will I ever be with somebody? I'm so lonely. I'm 19 and I don't have a clue what a relationship feels like. All my friends are talking about marriage and I've never even had a real kiss I cared about. I didn't think I was that bad, I guess I was wrong.	1
I can feel depression symptoms creeping up on me again, and I'm trying to fend them off.  I forced myself into a per-diem position today, just to keep in a routine.	1
I can't feel any emotion: happiness, sadness, anger, nothing at all. Just empty inside. Usually i have something in my head, that keeps thoughts inside, but now its nothing here except my inner voice. If i imagine this, it looks like a big endless gray room with voiceless me and my clone somewhere in that room.	1
The second goes as "What do you do from morning to night?	1
I'm so full of regret. I hate what I became. I hate that I married someone and am dragging them through the mud. To never have a real apartment or car. I can't hold a job. I barely take care of the house. I do dishes now but it is a real struggle.	1
So the last time I saw her in person was when she was on a break from teaching 3 months ago. Since then we have occasionally talked but it‚Äôs been me sending messages more than her. The last time we Skyped was 2 months ago and last time we had a proper conversation was a month and a half ago when I asked her for some advice about a trip I was going on. I then stopped messaging her for a few weeks as I didn‚Äôt want to bother her if she was busy. Started messaging again but just sending a few pictures of my trip and seeing if she wanted to talk. She saw my messages but didn‚Äôt reply. So I left it another week - I sent her a few messages today but again she was online and reading them and no reply. I have tried not to bother her if she‚Äôs busy and have stressed to her that I don‚Äôt want to bother her but she has just gone silent on me since late January and it‚Äôs basically been me trying to initiate conversation with her and her not responding.	0
The Hawaiian couple does not like my friend and I. They stop our oven mittens and tried to say they were there‚Äôs and hid them from us, refused to let us use the garbage can in the kitchen, and held little meetings about what it is we were doing wrong and how we could fix it.. I was so thrown back I ignore them at any chance and even had to take time out of my life to tell them how upsetting it is we had reached a level where they had to actually put sticky notes on things we could touch and could not touch. I find myself to be quite tidy and clean and fair but I guess there are two sides of the story always.	1
Thanks for reading.  Do you use nostalgia to escape the present or uncertainty of the future? I have been on a nostalgic trip for awhile and it makes me feel better, but then sad again when I come back to the present.	1
I scratch and I scratch, yet numbness blocks out the feeling	1
She hasn't spoken to me since.  She has blocked me anyway she can, even on WhatsApp only recently... not that it matters, because she wants nothing to do with me.	1
I opened the door, giving a brief greeting. I entered the meeting room of regrets and lost innocence, stroking my hands over what was a cuddly friend. My vision blurred, feeling the great exhaustion from the night prior taking me over. I curled in the corner, feeling the toilets flushing the pent up pains from an earlier disembarkment of a peanut gallery. I hugged the one thing that brought a soothing to my life, and proceeded to let out an ugly sob, trying to remember who everyone was, as I grabbed a broken mirror, staring at who the blurry stranger was in it.	1
It's been a horrible struggle recovering from the breakup. My coping techniques aren't working and I am slowly starting to give up at this point, sick and tired of feeling miserable.I can‚Äôt wait for this to pass! I just found out about my boyfriend and another woman this weekend. When I confronted him he told me to leave and hasn‚Äôt talked to me. I feel so low and can‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôm barely eating and spent the day at work fighting back tears. It feels unbearable right now. The days are manageable; it's the years that get me Day to day, aside from the struggle with getting out of bed, I can do OK. Put the mask on, survive the day, go home, go back to sleep (I guess I'm what they call high-functioning). The idea that I'm going to have to do this forever until I die makes me want to move that date up a bit.I can't handle this anymore I have no perspective in life. I am 19 but I feel like a 50 year old alcoholic. When I drink, I can't stop. Just for your information: I am "only" a social drinker. But the thing is, I am done. I don't know how I could get old. I can't handle life now even though I get everything spoonfed by my parents. I don't know how I could handle it later. I'm at that point where I don't even care if a car hits me. The thought of death is just so relieving. Btw I'm incredibly drunk (again) right now and I just wanted to share this.It's so much easier to fall back in than to fight against it I can't even handle the suicide hotline... I tried calling them and as soon as the guy on the other end started speaking, I had an incredible sense of fear and I started to cry and hung up. Fuck fuck fuck fuck. That guy could be saving lives and i'm here fucking wasting his time. I really should just fucking kill myself.In major distress because of my appearance This is something I've struggled with for so long, I don't know if I'll ever get over it. Just when I think I feel """""ok"""" with myself I look go look into the mirror and see a monster staring back at me. Don't even get me started on cell photos. No matter what angles I take or if I'm wearing make up I look horrible. I analyze all my facial features and compare them to conventionally attractive women, I know everything that's wrong with my face and why I'll never be called beautiful or sexy or even cute.	1
You: so why do you think you're a weak person? why are you empty inside?	1
I feel trapped and I need to get out for my own health, but I am deathly terrified he is going to kill himself if I leave. He told me I am the only thing holding him back from killing himself. I'm scared. He is such a good person when he isn't feeling this constant depression. I don't know how to get him to understand we just want to help him. He shuts me down every single day, and it hurts knowing he has given up on himself.	1
A little over a year ago my ex and I finally split after a long year and a half of on and offs filled with tons of emotional abuse. It was mainly her abusing me at first, getting angry for not texting her quickly enough, coming at my neck for hanging out with friends everynight ( I assume was because she stayed home all the time) and so on. The last couple times we dated she was always angry with me for cheating (which I never did) later to find out she was the one cheating on me. I was extremely depressed once we finally cut ties that I went back and talked to her and then she told me she cheated in detail so she could bring me down more.	1
She brought up the fact that I could do more around the house like organize the laundry or help her keep the home tidy. I told her I would if she wasn‚Äôt so damn unorganized. Every time i do end up helping her organize and clean she ends up messing everything up the next day anyway!	1
If anyone has any questions or would like to chat, need advice, whatever please let me know. I currently do volunteer work to aid people who suffer from Bipolar Disorder as well as others like ADHD or OCD. I also, accidentally, mentor Fatherless children on Xbox Live (strange, I know).	1
If you are reading this and have depression, I hope this helps you understand your own illness a little more clearly. If you're reading this and you don't have depression, I hope this gives you a good account of what it's like, so you can empathize with people who have depression.	1
Now, that's all over. I really only have one good friend left from those times and he doesn't even live near me anymore; sometimes I get really down when I think about old friends and start thinking about things I could've said differently that might've prevented the arguments we had that would eventually lead to the end of our friendship, I really never knew how much I needed them until they no longer wanted me in their lives. My relationship fizzled out in the same way and I've yet to develop a connection like that with anyone again. I've also gained all my weight back and can't stand to look at my own reflection.	1
My father hasn't spoken to me since I had a blow out 2 weeks ago.	1
This is me in one sentence. Nothing matters. I literally couldn't give a shit if i live or die. What does it matter. We're just a tiny flash on a rock flying through space. We don't mean shit. I don't mean shit. Life doesn't mean JACK FUCKING SHIT. I'm not even sad. I'm just totally numb. Happiness, sadness. Doesn't exist. Love, hate. Doesn't exist. Reason, meaning. Doesn't exist. We waste our short time on this world then we die. That's it. So why should I give a shit either way. I could kill myself right now. Would it change anything? Not really. I could go and get help, Meds and stuff, and I could probably be "happy" if I tried hard enough. Would it change anything? Not really. When nothing has any meaning then why should I do anything? I don't particularly WANT to die. But I see no reason to waste even more effort trying to live. It's a weird situation, but like I said before. I literally couldn't give a shit. 3 in the night and I can't stop crying People suck so much. I don't know why can't they just not hurt everyone and try to make others happy instead of sad.	1
Friday just felt different. She was less talkative with me than usual. She brought me cookies she made, and I thought that might be a sign that things were getting better, but after work I asked her if she had plans that weekend, and her answer was simply "yes". I said have fun and left. Normally she would have at least told me she a general idea of what she was doing.	1
She lives with her parents. While they have the best of intentions for their grandson, her mothers treatment of her is vile. She's cruel and demeaning. She constantly undermines her confidence and authority, saying she's stupid and doesn't know what she's doing in front of her son, and then, stupidly, complains that she get her son to listen to her. She regularly swears. She loudly gossips about everybody, complaining about with violent undertones. And to make it worse, she often threatens calling social services on her. Personally, I doubt she would, as she got far more incriminating evidence against her than her daughter. But either way, he would be taken from both of them.	0

I've tried meeting other people since then, and I've gone on exactly three dates with one person. That's it. I'm basically invisible to women, and no amount of effort will ever change that. I just have to accept the reality that I hold absolutely no value in a romantic context. Why? I don't know. Maybe it's because my generation is only interested in people who are aesthetically in the top tier, or make the most money. Maybe it's because my generation is eschewing committed relationships in favor of having fuck buddies left and right, whoring themselves out to whoever will get their rocks off, both men and women are at fault for this. I don't think I'm a particularly unattractive guy, and I make a pretty damn good amount of money for my age, but since I'm not in that top 10% of men, I'm just always going to be passed over and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. It's almost like there something inherent to my existence that prevents me from having any intimacy. No matter how much money I make or how much I improve myself, that intrinsic quality of my being will always hold me back. I didn't ask for this, but it's the way things are, so I've pretty much given up completely.	1
YEAR 4-6 IS IN THE SAME CLASS WITH THE SAME PEOPLE, in year 5 three people joined Year 4 kinda went the same as year 2 believe it or not. The classmates were ok, they didnt bully me, they talked to me when needed but that was it. I spent my time with some kids i met on the playground. But u know they were those kind of friends u just spent time with becuz nobody else is around. They never invited me to go to parties or to hang around or anything. This year was also the 1st year i told them about my Tourette Syndrome ( i got some damn weird looks at times and i didnt even realize i was making sounds). They understood, they acted more nice to me, i didnt feel left out so much but was still unhappy. And on runescape i got into a community (clan), made some good friends there. It was the only place in the word i was truly happy.	1
I don't even know who to talk to about this because I don't want to bother anyone, people have enough to worry about without me involving them in my problems, especially small ones like my feelings.I'm Ugly and it's killing me I'm quite young, still a teen. But I'm ugly as fuck. Even my best friends call me ugly. Even some people that I barely know have called me ugly in the past. And I'm not fat/out of shape. It's all in my genes. I'm aware that looks aren't everything but lets be real here; they matter a lot more than we'd like to admit. Not only when it comes to dating but also friendships as well as many other things. We prefer attractive people over unattractive ones no matter the context. My parents aren't ugly, my sister isn't ugly, I have no idea why I'm as ugly as I am. It kills me to think about what others think about my looks. I absolutely hate it.A letter to ‚Ä¶ my sister, who has conquered her depression The letter you always wanted to write...	1

To pretend, nothing happened. hey there depression, it‚Äôs me, ya boi (a letter for u by urs truly) dear depression,	1
Out of love... I'm still in love with her, but we can no longer be together. I'm scared of the world now. Constantly battling anxious thoughts and worries. I spend my days now trying to stay above water, to not drown in the depression. But no matter how well I swim that day, the pull is still my depressive state. Everyday it's like I'm staring into a black abyss that probably goes down infinitely. It's hypnotic and my main goal for the day is to pretend that this gaping exist actually doesn't exist within me.	1
For the last 6 months she‚Äôs stopped meeting up with me and responding to messages (or sending any). Instead she calls me at least once every week for often 2 - 3 hours asking for advice about men, her job and other stresses. She‚Äôll talk for over 20 mins uninterrupted, won‚Äôt stop talking when I need to go and will call even if I‚Äôve said I‚Äôll be out or unavailable.	0
ANyone have any advice to get me out of this rut and to feel less shit about wasting my youth ? Words of wisdom? Previous similar experiences etc?I don't want to get out of depression I've had it for so long I just can't get out amymore... I feel like I don't deserve to get out because of all the stupid stuff I've made... I'm starting to not take my pills and trying to socialize less..	1
In August, she fell pregnant.  This could have been the week prior the Anniversary of our first kiss, but the nurse dated it on that specific date.  That was one of the nights she cheated on me, with her friend's boyfriend, but it was "just a kiss".	1
Stranger: damn	1
Even so, listening to them fight right now makes me really uncomfortable. You'd think my hate would just make me careless about  it but its just notif you're lonely.. F/17/AUS I'm very active online and have insomnia, so timezones probably aren't an issue. I am very loyal and caring, with lots of love to give, especially to those who can show that they want it :)	1
...I'm gonna go hug my pillow now. Whenever I try to change my life these thoughts pop up Had depression and anxiety for years and have many times tried to make changes to my life. But I can't shake the thought that says: "why bother?". "Why suffer through all that extra pain that change requires just for a long shot chance of a normal life?".	1
You: i guess the only option we have is to meet our doom and continue with life. the only other possibility is to jump off of the highest building in the world	1
EDIT:	1
I've tried with different cats to fill the empty void, but they were never aware of me. Archer was always where I was, and were going. I cry every time I lay down in bed, look to my side and expect a short purr and a hop to my lap.. now there's nothing.People are NOT who they seem. I originally wrote a long post detailing the specifics of what just happened to me, but I decided not to. All I'm saying is, **don't** trust anybody. You have **zero** assurance that people who act nice and fine when you're around are really nice and fine towards you when your back's turned.	1
Then we have comments like "Just put a life together that wont make you depressed". I think these piss me off the most. If it was really that simple you think I would of done that by now? Also a lot of people don't mention how hard changing your life can be if you don't have money or resources.	1
I hope this wasn't too personal, but I wanted to be as raw and honest as possible.	1
____________________________________	1
So uhh is this a problem? Or is it normal?I want to pay off my debt then kill myself. I came from a really poor family, worked hard during primary and secondary school. Got a scholarship for college which paid me 10k a year as well as covering my school fees. Gave parents the money, it paid for the bills as well as my siblings's school fees. Thought life was good, studying what i love. However, i got bullied until i cant take it anymore and requested a change of class, the school rejected my request. I then requested to take a semester off school, but the contract for the scholarship states that i have to complete school by 3 years or the contract will be terminated. Failed a module and i have to extend my time in college by a year, which caused my scholarship to be terminated. Which in turn placed me in a 30k debt. Now, i don't have money to pay for school, so i had to leave. Im out without any qualifications except for a secondary school cert, with the organisation that offered me the scholarship requesting 1k per month for installments. I've always looked forward to my dream job, i was so close, i volunteer every weekend to get experience from that job. Now it feels like everything is taken from me. I appealed to have my scholarship reinstated 3 times, explaining the issues that i had, giving them the medical reports from my doctors, bringing up the volunteer work i did. But on the latest attempt, i got a call saying that they never planned to accept my appeal. It really feels like everything is taken from me. I feel like just working to pay off my debt so as to not burden my family as the debtors will go for them if i die now. There's nothing to look forward to anymore. 3 years of suffering incomingI Could Use Some Support Right Now Yesterday my best friend of five years attempted to kill their self. I'm currently being blown away by school (grad school if it really matters). I don't know what to think at all. This is midterm week and most my profs are understanding but the one class I'm worried about the prof gave me the option of writing and being stuck with whatever mark I get or not writing and the weight being shifted onto my final but I need the feedback to decide if I'm going to even stay in the course because it's incredibly difficult. It just feels like nothing is going my way currently and it's so hard to study or focus. side note; another prof let me write as  told them (like I did the other) that I wanted it as a distraction and said that if I did bad they'd shift the weight to my final. Despair is the normal state of my life I haven't drank though. I have no urge to drink. I just want to stop.	1
I can't believe what happened.. its been making me upset and eating me up. I don't talk lots and everyone at the dealership liked me. I always work my hardest in my little desk of mine. I guess my hardest wasn't enough.i can‚Äôt have string lights in my room. this gonna sound dumb as hell but there was a period of time where i had string lights in my room and i was really depressed and dysphoric during that time and now whenever i try to put them up and turn them on it just reminds me of how sad i was? i want to be able to enjoy them without feeling like shit and not associate bad memories with themWaking up tomorrow with a fresh mindset, again. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna really fucking try to do this. I'm going to have a good day. I'm going to be happy. I'm going to be productive. Let's go.I miss the days where I at least had depression sleep to look forward to. More of a vent here so bare with me. I have not had a good night of undisturbed deep sleep where I wake up feeling refreshed in years. Like, I kinda autopilot through my day trying to ignore how nothing really excites or motivates me and that I've stopped progressing towards any dreams or goals, and the more I'm awake the longer I have to struggle with that and I don't even have sleep to look forward to. I used to be able to sleep through anything and for many hours at a time. It was awesome. Idk, just like I'm riding a vicious cycle of depression worsening sleep, sleep worsening depression slowly downwards to the point where I think not existing would finally feel like the best damn rest I ever had.	1
The thoughts of whatever I had done for him to hate me weighs so heavy upon me, that I fear to live with a guilt that was my own. I failed to be the person he wanted me to be, but worse; I failed to be the person I needed to be for him.	1
1) I haven‚Äôt had a decent job. I‚Äôve been floating on jobs that get me less than five hours a week.	1
Don‚Äôt ever think twice about it,	1
I meet a guy. He‚Äôs cute, a little simple, but cute. We start to hang out, workout together even. He takes me to some of the most beautiful places, I try to swallow my doubt and bring my heart back. Somedays, I could swallow just fine around him.	1

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, she went to Sweden on a vacation with her best friend and had a blast and was calling me everyday so happy and excited. I thought we had a legitimate break through. Then one week before she returns i start to only get 1 or 2 text a day, I figure she is living her best life to busy with international travel to communicate regularly like she requested.	1
I'm incredibly insecure. I have some combination of body dysmorphia and an eating disorder. I'm probably quite good looking but I've never been in a relationship; I'm still a kissless virgin. This eats me alive and makes me afraid to talk to women. Another reason to isolate further.	1
When needed I take: baclofen 10-20mg, Xanax up to 2mg, Flexeril 10mg and Zanaflex 4mg. Should I go to the hospital? [please respond] Minor living with adult sibling right now. Idk whether I should go to the hospital. I‚Äôve had suicidal urges surface recently and I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôll succumb to the temptations and kill myself.	1
Sorry for the formatting I‚Äôm on mobile. I don‚Äôt know if this is the right sub for this either, I just needed to get this off my chest. I am tired of spending every weekend crying. It didn't used to be this bad. I was fine being alone and forgotten. I don't know what changed though. I guess it all just caught up to me. I have felt depressed for as long as I can remember but I was always able to handle it. I am really losing it lately though. Last year was bad. This year is already worse. I am too much of a quitter to make things better. I don't even know why I am posting this. I guess I just want someone to know I was hear. Honestly, i don't know if it's worth it anymore. I wake up, there's only fucking trouble and chaos around me, all of my family members are suffering from anxiety and depression, things only look worse by the day.	1
"I don't want to live another day"	1
I believe all of these things because I know I'm a failure at life, and I know I'm not "built" to survive and dwell in this world. One day, I will end my life just when my fantasies can no longer be maintained.Anti depressants Hey guys wanted to know your thoughts on anti depressants? What worked, what didn't, side effects and just any advice from experience. People I love keep dying. I can't take it anymore. On New Year's Eve I got a phone call at 1 in the morning that one of my closest friends died. I didn't believe it. I thought it was a joke. It wasn't. His brother made a post on Facebook letting everyone know. It felt like a bad dream.	1
I'm not sure how long I can keep doing this for. Not the drink, the whole thing. I wish I could cry really hard. I feel like that would help but it never comes.I'm quitting my job. I've been working at a department store for about 5 months yet, and I just can't do it anymore.  There's too much to know and I just can't keep up.  People who have been there 3 weeks are telling me how to do things.	1
You will find that your mood will be better or more stable with vitamin D consumption.	1
The state then places me in an incredibly religious home where i essentially become a slave and i cook and clean nonstop for an extremely wealthy catholic couple. They don't like me Because I liked hard rock.	1
I‚Äôm sorry. I know this post is all over the place. I don‚Äôt even know where to start. I just wish that I had SOMEONE to talk to to set me straight Nd to encourage me. My husband tries his best and he does a GREAT job, but he has no idea what it feels like....I just failed some classes and now my family is disappointed in me. I just ended the semester today and I failed 2 out of my three classes and now everyone in my family is looking down on me and talking about how I used to be so smart and That I'm not now. At dinner, they were making jokes about how I'm not gonna graduate and how I'm not gonna get a job. My mom knows about my depression and even my past suicide attempt and self-harm. She just decides to brush it under the rug and act like it doesn't exist. I tell her how I am trying my hardest and how I gave it my all and she is just thinking that I am lazy. This is all bullshit. I bet they couldn't last an hour trying to deal with I deal will every day. Fuck this.Just wanted to let it out I wanna kill myself. I'm seriously depressed and I can't bring myself to trust in others and tell them. Maybe because I can leave myself the option if no one knows to stop me if I want to go. But for now, I guess I'll keep hiding it. It's nice to be able to say it though, even if no one on here sees it. Falling in love with someone who doesn't feel the same way is the worst thing I've felt. I've been struggling with depression for quite some time now,  but nothing has come close to how shit I feel now. She was my closest friend, we shared everything together. Now we havnt spoken to eachother in over a month and it just amplifies my depressive thoughts. I just can't get her out of my head. There are so many things in my every day life that reminds me of her.  I just wish I could forget everything, just to end this suffering.I got a job and I made new friends I‚Äôve been sitting on my ass for the last 3 years while my boyfriend supports us both because I could never face my anxiety of job interviews, etc. Some days just getting out of bed is a victory for me. I finally forced myself to try and I got a job! I‚Äôve made two friends so far and I don‚Äôt totally hate living right now. Making money and being able to help out is giving me a sense of self worth and I haven‚Äôt felt like this in so long. I‚Äôm not trying to brag, I‚Äôm just proud of myself and no one around me really understands how big of a deal it is. I tried taking a bunch of pills a few weeks ago and I had no idea that I‚Äôd be semi (dare I say) happy right now. It can get better ladies and gents, you just have to wait for it, I guess. Idk what I‚Äôm saying lol thank you for reading my babbleI‚Äôve been feeling down this whole week I feel pretty lonely. I thought about texting this girl I dated for a brief moment because I‚Äôm so lonely and I just want someone.	1
Thank you to all those who responded to my last post, it really means a lot. It showed me I‚Äôm not alone in this, it helped me a lot. So depressed that I developed disassociation. So I am going to bed after posting thus so sorry if I don't respond right away.	1
All my graduation photos, friend hang outs, and all just precious moments, will have to go. I've always been looked down upon. I was never up to standard to anyone. No matter how hard I try to fit in, I knew I was an outlier. And now that all these memories of my bitter-sweet life will have to disappear. I should disappear along with themPeople who have sought professional help? Was it worth it? I know it's a positive start. I have never sought professional help so I'm not diagnosed with any mental or emotional conditions, however, I feel so empty and sad all the time. I tried talking to my parents however my dad  told me to man up and my mother goes on about Jesus. I've spent the past 3 years at uni in a foreign country, I go like 10 classes max per semester, n once failed an entire semester because I couldn't bring myself to do more than leave the bed most days. If I stick it out I Kno I have a path to a good career (dad has connections, blah blah I Kno) n a few people ive talked to basically tell that I'm spoilt and "have it good." I feel guilty for existing sometimes. Guess I'm jus rambling now, have finals in about 5hrs n I'm doing my usual caffeine fueled all nighter to save something I don't intrinsically care about but still need cuz I'd feel even shittier if I don't get my degree. N when I do get it, I'll be just as purposeless and empty while im pursuing the next career step, it's a fucked up cycle.I sometimes wish something awful would happen to me to justify my depression. I feel I don't deserve help because I've no reason to be depressed. But I am. I‚Äôm 21 almost 22 and I feel like I haven‚Äôt accomplished enough at my age. My age has been bothering me so much because everyone else my age is already ten steps ahead of me. I still live with my parents and it‚Äôs so embarrassing and I‚Äôm trying to save up to move out, but my social anxiety has caused my employer to cut my hours. So what‚Äôs the point in being alive? I ask myself this everyday and there really isn‚Äôt one, there is no point in being here you live to die and everything in the middle is a pointless void.My story, i have to get this off my chest. Life sucks Hello everyone,	1
I hate using the term ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù. Even as I‚Äôm writing this, I feel like I want to delete it. It‚Äôs being thrown around so much lately that I feel like I‚Äôm just being a little bitch that uses it like I don‚Äôt know it.	1
I feel I like I can't talk to anyone and it's suffocating	1
I give up. I just want to die.	1
There's no knocks on your door	1
And it got me thinking about all of the baggage I've he'd onto my life. All the glances and side comments and nasty, hateful things. And how I've internalized it, and believed it.	1
In the end, I feel like I educated him on depression and hopefully helped debunk his belief that depression is just a feeling that people should be able to snap out of. I honestly don't think I could have these conversations if I was in the state I was even a month ago. Even today, I felt myself slipping into the familiar downward spiral. I don't know what kept me composed today, but I'm so proud of myself for making it through the conversation without snapping or becoming defensive. Perhaps if I had these conversations in reverse order, it could've been a completely different experience.	1
Stranger: its vaping lol	1
Cold sheets, I wait to sleep Everyday, everyday, repeat.	1
That's it. I needed to rant. I'm sorry if I sound like a spoiled brat.	1
Turns out, I‚Äôve been pretty sick and needed surgery. Nearly all of the issues they blamed on depression were due to a chronic, painful illness with no cure. It‚Äôs bittersweet, I‚Äôve solved a big piece of the puzzle for sure. But I‚Äôm still struggling a lot.	1
With a core belief like that there's no life to live. Career advancement serves no purpose but to consume more time, and I'd be taking a good job from someone who actually gets some personal value out of it. Romance is off the cards because someone who wants to date someone who doesn't want anything from life, probably also isn't worth being with. And heaven forbid someone should want kids! Hey Junior, daddy doesn't like his existence but he had you anyway, what an asshole.	1
Sorry for the rambling. Have a good nightMy favorite place to be is at home in bed With a pillow over my head. Cause it‚Äôs dark and it‚Äôs quiet.  And I feel like I‚Äôm dead.       I got laid off but my coworker that stole $1000 didn't. I was a new sales person at a dealership. I was very sick and went into work. My boss dismissed me because I sick and told me not to come back until I was better.	1
- There are religious currents, including periodic 'prayer meetings' throughout the day.  I was treated dismissively when I objected and stated I'm not religious.  The owner is okay with the prayers, and says it brings staff closer together.	1
Walk to work, continue to fight with anger issues re: relationships and validation. Sometimes frustration stems from lack of work success but more often than not it‚Äôs physical appearance issues and relationship issues. I get caught in a loop being mad at her and being mad at myself and my capacity to deal with being alone.	1
I like stepping outside in the cold to smoke and feel the warmth when I re-enter the building.	1
Thank you all for the detailed and informed replies.	1
MY EX fucked my life up with cheating on me, and since then i have big trust issues, aswell i tend to get very jelous now when my best friend is getting new friends and seems to have more fun with them then me.	1
Should I end this life of mine?	1
-&gt; Be a zombie at school while pretending my feelings don't exist	1
On the day we were meeting he text me at 5pm and asked ‚Äòare you still up for the cinema?‚Äô and following advice from my friends, I said ‚Äòno thanks‚Äô and told him it‚Äôs unbelievable that after everything hes done he chose to blow off hanging out with me to hang out with other friends, and lied about it. I also said he‚Äôs not busy, he‚Äôs just a shit friend. He said he agrees that I‚Äôm a better friend than him but he never hangs out with anyone sober and he‚Äôs trying his best. He said he was making an effort to match his actions to his words by spending time with me alone. I didn‚Äôt reply.	0
It's been happening a lot lately during the night... especially since I've been moderately sick lately and it feels like my body is giving up on me no matter what I try... eating healthy and exercising only takes away the feelings of loneliness and sickness a little bit. What really helps is interaction with others, whether it be watching live programs or being on xbox talking to people or being in chat rooms because it gives me a small sense of community and belonging that I lose when my mind is left alone to itself.	1
Balance upset into leaning on death Simplified option to life's little test Constantly guarding against its attack Why were we put here to feel its effect Violent pressure has tired my tries It is my wish that it's soon that I die Hanging by threads to the realms of the sane It is this world that has made me this way	1
TL;DR Sleep is elusive, i want to sleep more than anything. Please help. I don't think who try to kill themselves actually want to die From my experience and one of a close friend who almost died in a car accident, I think people don't really want to die. We just want the pain to go away. All the shit we take  and all the heavy baggage we have to carry, just makes us tired and lose hope	1

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm trapped in my mind. The only way out would destroy my family, but I can‚Äôt even stand the thought of hurting my family.can I be fired for going to the hospital again? I missed 2 months of work and went in FMLA last year for inpatient and then out patient. I'm getting worried that I'll try to kill myself soon and think maybe I should go inpatient to get a few days away from everything and maybe then I won't be as much if a danger to myself and can think more clearly. I'm really worried that if I leave work for a week or two again that I'll be fired. idk what to do. I guess if I don't go I might kill myself then I won't have to worry about work idksoftly rejected Heyo. I‚Äôve been struggling with loneliness for awhile now. When I went to college, I met this guy and we‚Äôve been talking for about awhile now. We hooked up last weekend and I decided to ask him if he wanted anything more. Basically, he said he was too busy for one and that he would let me know when he wanted one. Honestly, this is so much worse than a rejection. I just feel usedis anyone out there... 22 year old black male. NY. around so many people i feel like a lost soul. &amp; it don‚Äôt seem like anyone understands me. so i still feel... different... i started typing about my childhood but that‚Äôs a story in itself so i‚Äôll keep it to my more recent years. suicide.. it‚Äôs growing on me everyday. just for the simple fact that i think myself into this mood where i think everyone‚Äôs life would be easier without me around. not to toot my own horn but i‚Äôm pretty popular, so i know people would be affected by it for a couple days but who really CARES enough to actually help my mind get to a better place? i‚Äôve seen it happen plenty of times in this place i call home. i have had the same friends for 10+ years, very authentic friends but i feel we‚Äôre outgrowing each other.. youngest kid to a very loving hard working single mother of 3 but i always felt like the odd child.. &amp; currently in a 2 year relationship with a girl anyone would want.. (i recently started blaming her for cheating from thinking too much) but yet, i don‚Äôt feel not even half complete. i shut down &amp; don‚Äôt talk to those who mean most to me to the point where they think i have a problem with them... &amp; i don‚Äôt know how to control it. i was never able to talk to a counselor or mentor cause i never felt real love from them. but sometimes i think i just need a open ear i can vent to without everyone else knowing about it. that seems to never happen though. not to sound like a hippy, loll but i live my life off of vibes, if you know what i mean.. &amp; as of late i don‚Äôt even know what a vibe is. i just want to be left alone to think. recently deleted all social media accounts, just isolating myself from my surroundings.. i feel like everything is coming to an end soon. idk. i just need that push. i don‚Äôt want to be a waste of life when it‚Äôs all said &amp; done. When did you decide to get help? What was the tipping point? I‚Äôm been having thoughts and feelings lately and I want to compare them to when other people decided to take the plunge. There are days when I‚Äôm happy but most nights and some days are not as good. Recently I‚Äôve been struggling and I try to remind myself that it‚Äôs not so bad and I could have it worse etc. But anyway. I don‚Äôt want to go into a lot of detail or get really personal but for context I‚Äôm a college senior. I went to a psychiatrist when I was young (like 7 or 8) and I took medicine for depression but they made me aggressive according to my mom so I didn‚Äôt take them long. I haven‚Äôt seen anyone, including a school counselor, since then. However in late high school/early college I struggled with self harm. These days I just feel so tired and empty and I just want to sleep. I need to get this out. Feel free to ignore it.(Potential Triggers: Domestic and parental abuse, self harm, bullying, substance abuse etc. Avoiding detail AMAP) I am so sick of trying to just survive each day. I want more than anything to go out and live my life. I want a job, an apartment, a pet... but instead I‚Äôm stuck living with my grandparents because I‚Äôm at the point where my agoraphobia is so bad I can BARELY leave my bed. I don‚Äôt think I have felt ‚Äúhappy‚Äù for more than 10 minutes at any given time in the last 6 months. I applied to try to get a tattoo to cover some scars I have from when I got really bad, but they never contacted me again...so that reminder is always there making me feel sick and myself and taunting me to do it again just to numb the crap in my head. I‚Äôm trying to be a partner to this amazing guy I care a ton about, but I feel so emotionally shut down that I don‚Äôt even react to jokes or love anymore. I don‚Äôt even like when he cuddles me because his breath on my neck is a trigger... Now, I do not have it as bad as a lot of other people. I grew up in a family with a loving (OCD) grandmother, a grandfather, and a (drug addict) mother who all always made sure I had food and a place to sleep. That alone is more than a lot of people get...but every time I try to talk to someone and they don‚Äôt respond to me I flip out at them because my mom didn‚Äôt want me to interrupt her high. When something goes SLIGHTLY wrong or is a SMIDGE out of place I panic because that‚Äôs all I had around me. When someone on the street spits I flinch because my ex‚Äôs favourite way to degrade me was to spit in my face while mocking me. When I go downtown I get anxious because that‚Äôs where I was publicly beating by a (different yet no les ‚Äúcharming‚Äù) ex. I avoid drinking now because I don‚Äôt want to fall into drinking to feel happy again and I definitely don‚Äôt want to add to my scars...but this is all I have known my whole life. Every time I try to take a step forward, improve myself, or even leave the house to do something I once enjoyed, it feels like the weight of every circumstance and bad decision in my life is right there to push me further into the dirt. The only ways I know how to make money aren‚Äôt things I want to do...the only people in my life I want to be around I can‚Äôt stand to be near...I feel like I have nothing left to hold onto and I‚Äôm drowning! I‚Äôd check into the hospital just to get away, but unless I were to actually make an attempt on my life they wouldn‚Äôt accept me (but at least we have free healthcare right?)... I just need a day of normal.....Anyone want to talk with me tonight? Just lonely, need to get out of my head.Things that I liked about today so far **Maybe the only way to escape depression is gratitude. Cicero, one of the senators of Rome in the early days of the empire is quoted to have said "Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others."	1
Just before Christmas my third wife moved out, and I spent Christmas alone because my parents were sick. Last night she told my mom she intends to get a divorce.	1
Stranger: o's all day	1
Does anyone else have friends that act like they like you but never text you to hang out or see how you‚Äôre doing? I don‚Äôt have a single friend who will text me to hang out. I always have to start the conversation. Every time we hang out though people seem to enjoy my presence. I don‚Äôt get it why does no one like me, it feels like everyone is just acting nice but secretly hates me.	1
lol...Sigh. Sometimes I just want to fall asleep peacefully to my music, and never wake up. Sometimes I just want someone to talk to and get my mind off things. I complain too much, and I feel like a burden to them. There's only one person who understands, but he will forget me. Once that happens Ill be back to living my pathetic life again. Being told by my brother making friends isn‚Äôt that hard for someone my age bothers me every time I think about it It‚Äôs pretty damn hard when I have no hobbies to relate to anyone except stay in my room on my computer because I‚Äôd rather just be away from everyone so I don‚Äôt make it hard on them.	1
I don't want this. **ANY of this.**	1
But then I turned super suicidal and had mental breakdowns over mental breakdowns.	1
**tl;dr**: got lethargic and lacked focus this last year, diagnosed with depression and Lyme's disease, been on escitalopram since spring and Adderall (whenever I choose to take it) since mid-Mayish.	1
So what I‚Äôm trying to do is work on myself.	1
Edit: I am depressed, and I got this feeling of wanting to be depressed and idk why. Maybe to let people see that I'm having a hard time and get some comfort. Again, idk. I can't put my feelings into words atm.My depression is an excuse I can‚Äôt help but feel like my depression and suicidal thoughts are just an excuse to be lazy and not try in lifeLonely and stupid. I feel so stupid.	1
Just give me something... Please...People say life is fragile Well life isnt that fragile. financial reasons as I mentioned before I am trying to kill myself. It is so hard. I really need someone to talk to about fucking anything just to kill the loneliness rn. Talk to me about anything ask me anything at all no holds barred pm me if you want idc. As long as it‚Äôs conversation it‚Äôs great.I die a little inside with every customer (TW) Let me start by saying I've been getting help for chronic depression and anxiety since January. I take sertraline (50mg) every day, and it's helped me tremendously. I was hired as a cashier at a fast food job in November of last year, and it was a huge step forward. No education, no GED, no transportation, no job experience (except for working for a family company since I was a literal child); needless to say, I felt like I overcame a hump that had been looming in front of me for quite some time. I've had extreme social anxiety since my early teens, so diving headfirst into a cashier job seemed a bit counter-intuitive. Now, I don't know if it was the medication or simply having no choice but to face my fears every day, but the anxiety has completely faded. Gone. Zilch. Good, right? Well, in its place, a little seedling sprouted, and as time goes by it swells inside my heart and head, pushes against my skull, crushes my organs, my spark, my will to move forward. I hate people so fucking much. I am so damn tired of hearing you complain that the price of a sandwich has increased by fifty fucking cents. I am so damn tired of cleaning up after your little brats after they throw their food on the floor. I am so fucking fed up with you cancelling an entire fucking order, after it was already prepared, because the soda machine was out of cherry Fanta. What the fuck is wrong with you? I go home and utterly dread the next day of picking up the slack of my coworkers and dealing with a shitload of entitled, spoiled assholes. Every now and then, there is an angel. Someone who isn't a total asshole to me...it could be something so small to you, but it can make my entire day that much easier. Perhaps you already know what you want to order, and don't hold up a line of ten people because you're picky as fuck. Perhaps you tip me 96 cents. Usually, it's treating me like I'm a feeling, thinking human instead of the shit on your heel. I bend over backwards for these people and do my best to let them know that they're truly appreciated. I've come so far, and yet I'm so close to giving up. It's wearisome forcing a smile every day and powering through as if I have a promising future, when I don't. I pretend that I don't slice my thighs with razors, that I'm not covered in self harm scars, that all is well. I pretend I don't fantasize every day about diving headfirst in front of a semi truck. I pretend the love of my life and best friend isn't homeless and isn't living in a tent with a heroin addict. I pretend, I pretend, I pretend. I am so tired.	1
Point is, I‚Äôm very sad and I feel like I‚Äôm getting worse everyday. I don‚Äôt know what to do with my life. The one thing I was good at is now gone. I don‚Äôt have any other talents or interest.I feel empty without soccer and I don‚Äôt know how to feel it.	1
I'm stupider than I used to be. How I interpret the simplest of sentences or instruction is out of whack. I have trouble reading though I've got tons of read Omnibuses from Warhammer 40k on my bookshelf. I have trouble speaking. I talk slowly and can barely push out the words off my tongue. I'm only recently able to make phonecalls without losing my mind anxiety wise.	1
Sorry i know others have more bigger problems but these are mine.I wonder what god wants from me Im fat, ugly and unemployed 27 year old (im a director in my fathers firm but i do nothing at work all day)	1
How can I kill this voice? It's ruining my self esteem and happiness.In need of some conversation I‚Äôm going through a really hard time I don‚Äôt want to explain this through the chat please pm me Depression is the enemy you can't beat I am a fighter like I play brutal sports in college and I'm used to pain, but when it comes to depression I want to defeat it in one simple step but it's not that easy. I go through days where I feel better knowing that there's nothing for me to screw up. I have these feelings not only at night when I'm alone but when I'm with friends and I know that they don't understand it because I get the normal response of "everybody feels that way man." and that's just a worse thing for me to think about. if everyone has it I must be a failure for letting it affect me in such a way where I cant get anything done for school and I just sit on my computer all day. Its miserable.Two weeks notice If I plan on killing myself, should I put one in and wait two weeks to do it? Seems kinda dickish if I just off myself while I‚Äôm scheduled to work, but it‚Äôs not like I do much there anyway. What do you think?. I feel like I don't have a heart anymore, or a soul, or a personality, whatever. It's been broken too many times by people and by myself. I don't know how to feel anything anymore. I feel empty, bored and lonely. I wish I wasn't here but I don't want to die, but I feel like I'll end up doing it one day. Constant worrying is killing me Has anyone got any help at all to help you distract yourself from someone close to you going AWOL?	1
This morning I said Hi and she replied Hey back and then I asked her what she was up to and she just didn't reply again. I don't blame her if she isn't interested, that's fair enough it happens. She was sending x's up until she stopped texting back though and its not something i thought i was being naive about thinking she was interested in me but maybe i was wrong.	1

Then at work I made a $5 billion discovery that is extremely disruptive in the industry I work in. My quarter million dollar program found out millions are being spent on the wrong strategy. And 1/2 my team works on the other strategy at the same time as they are helping me, so they are taking steps to undermine the findings. Lately they gave up trying to block the discovery, and the fact that we can literally feed more people with no more land used for farming, by raising more animals (naturally) with the same amount of feed. I'm getting invited to speak globally about the discovery. The suicidal thoughts deepen, knowing the disruption to status quo is only beginning.	1
Yet I'm hard to read, I'm one to bleed	1
Who knows, so today let's just stand in the rain	1
My dad said yes of course but the following month my dad said my stepmom wasn‚Äôt feeling it. She want space and doesn‚Äôt really want to be around kids that often. My dad offered money but it was about help.	0
So why this post? Because it is killing me.  I don't know how, but I'm still kicking.  Depression is creeping at my door, and I do have horrible days, bad days where I am so demotivated.	1
I really connect with this.Can we talk about comments for a minute This subreddit has helped me so much and it has helped thousands of people just the same. It is supposed to be a place of understanding and help, but when I see comments saying "tough luck" "boo hoo poor me" or anything of the sort I just infuriates me to the extreme. If you're not here to help or be helped then simply leave, this community is for helping those in need, not for trolling or for laughing at. It's seriously sick that people would be so cruel to others when they didn't ask for anything but help. If you're not here to help, leave, simple as that.I got really drunk and talked to myself for 5 hours straight sitting alone in a dark kitchen. It felt good. It sounds crazy, but i felt so relieved, i literally started saying everything i ever wanted to say, about depression, world, society, about my suicide attempts, dissapointments, dreams, pain, everything i ever wanted to say. I think im going insane.Any advice on how to handle leaving my only friend? LAST thing I need right now is the pain but I think I have to. I've posted here a few times before and never got much for replies, which is ok.  I really do hope I can get some insight on this particular issue however.	1
Stranger: thats just life tho	1
I don't know.	1
My next chapter in life had started once I arrived back from Taiwan and had seen my boyfriend again. I had decided I wanted to move to a Portland permanently, found a decent student housing apartment, enrolled for school, I was excited... now this is where things become a bit much for me and why I‚Äôm here today.	1
I mean, what kind of reaction one expects from posts like this? I realize that op doesn't really want advices, he just wants to vent and I admit I've done the same, but honestly, did I feel better? Did I feel better after I realized other people are suffering with me? No. Maybe if I told a friend, to my brother that I'm feeling like shit, maybe, I would feel better,but to unknown people on the internet? What they tell me is worthless.	1
When I got home the next day, she told me off. Really badly. She told me to go to hell, called me all sorts of names and I feared... I feared I would never be able to find someone like her again.	1
I don't want to be in a relationship for it to fix my depression, I'm going to therapy, taking antidepressants for 6 years now and I am fully aware being with someone isn't a cure ( I was with someone while depressed for 2 years ). I wanted to reply to this person to explain they misunderstood me, but I was too upset, so I deleted the post.	1
I've always struggled with depression, i've had it for like 6 years now. But lately for some reason it has gotten really bad, to the point that i can't even live my life anymore. I can't concentrate on school, i don't feel like talking to people, i don't feel like replying to messages. I don't even feel like crying anymore, i just feel like a mess. All i do everyday now is listen to music, listen to music and daydream. Daydream of all the things that i really want to do, but i just can't find the motivation to actually do.	1
At this point, I dont even really see the point in this. In just living in a loveless life in constant pain with nothing to look forward to.	1
Is there anything I can do? I don't know what a pill could do for me or if a pill works. I think the brain is so complex that it couldn't, but I guess I don't know. I don't want to be in a mental fog or be unaware or not be me anymore. I've also always kind of thought that it's human nature to feel this way: that everybody gets down, gets bored, thinks about their mortality, etc. and that I'm just being soft and need to suck it up. Life is difficult, I just need to learn to deal with it maybe.	1
You can never question someone who killed themselves as to whether their pain was real. Not just in the sense that they're no longer around to ask but that no one would ask what everyone inherently knows. Of course they felt pain. I feel that might be suicides greatest allure. It effectively puts a stamp on your sadness as legitimate.	1
I really need advice right now.  You know what i realised? I cant really get to sleep at all and have been doing alot of thinking. I just realised that i am in control. The thought of this makes me really happy. I am smiling ear to ear. I dont know i am just feeling really fucking good and decided to type about it. As soon as i wake up im gonna destroy this fucking day. Also as soon as i get back to college im gonna tell this one girl that i like her. Fuck yeah!99% of my days are spent in bed I sleep, wake up, lay in bed, sleep then repeatAnyone else feel guilty about people checking up on them? A part of me feels happy because its nice knowing people care about me. Then I realize they‚Äôre only doing this either because of 1.BellLetsTalk or 2.Because they know im depressed and they would never do this if I didn‚Äôt tell them I was I just feel like it‚Äôs sort of fake in a way even though I know they care.NOTHING makes me happy anymore. What are some things that still make yall happy? What daily tasks or activities do you still find happiness in? Please list a few. I'm hoping maybe i can steal some of yours and find some happiness in them as well.  Thank u! I still feel "temporary" happiness sometimes but it never lasts more than 30min.  I want real happiness! I'm afraid i've forgot what that feels likeFailure to trust ‚Äò‚Äôthose on my side‚Äô‚Äô. [possible trigger Warning] I find myself incapable of trusting my spouse. I‚Äôve been with my SO for nearly 15 years, 7 married this year, we have 3 children. Before I hit my mid-teens I‚Äôd been through nearly a decade of sexual abuse within the already dysfunctional household I grew up one, with an alcoholic father and a narcissistic mother.	1
Everytime I think of anything that gives me anxiety I feel the need to pick at my skin. My face is red and scabbed.	1
I started talking to her friends, because they seemed like such wonderful people to me. Then we met up, all of us. She kept crying and making scenes. Few weeks before that, she accused me of liking HER friends more than I liked her. But when we all met, it seemed alright, save for her crying etc...	1
I ruined everything. My relationship with my family is ruined. I love my parents beyond belief, and I know they love me too, but the shame, and the sadness I feel just being around them, it‚Äôs constantly unbearable. Nothing feels normal anymore. It hasn‚Äôt since that fucking day. I would give anything, literally anything to go back. I‚Äôd rather be completely paralyzed than do what I did to my family.	1
I just want to do my homework. I don't want these thoughts anymore. I'm not sure i actually will.Reminder that it will get better. Everyday I get home from my part time job, I cry for at least half an hour before I get up to go inside and finish the rest of my day.	1
Cast down, cast down.	1
For at least 5 years, I have a hard time doing anything outside of my job alone without crawling up inside my head. All the things that I used to do for enjoyment like listening to music or playing video games, I just can't do anything anymore. It's like a wave of apathy that very rarely lifts. Occasionally, I pick up a razor blade and will press it into my shoulder or hand and I don't really know why to be honest. I don't know if I like the pain or maybe I like having something else to focus on for a minute. Or just to feel something that isn't apathy for a moment.	1
I just feel like I‚Äôve been forgotten and it hurts so, so much Question about depression: My boyfriend suffers from PTSD and depression, what's the most effective way to support him? I know that I can NEVER understand his depression. Even if I suffered from it too, I still couldn't understand through his eyes and in his shoes. What's the best and most effective way I can support him?Been medically diagnosed with depression I haven't been feeling the best physically lately dizziness, etc and I'm generally quite fit and healthy.  I've been wanting not to do anything besides be at home with friends for while, my ex dumped me cause I would find it unpleasant to go outside of the house. But I don't feel sad at all. I don't feel worked at all I just feel like everything is going at 10x speed.Just tied a noose I just looked up some videos and learned to tie a noose. Suicide is all I can think of right now and I'm scared to do it only because the thought of becoming a vegetable and having to live like that terrifies me. I guess this is one more step I'm trying out to kind of ease myself into the whole thing.	1
