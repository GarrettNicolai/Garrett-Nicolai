You: no with my roomates currently	1
Anyway, thanks for reading and stuff. Felt good to vent a little. What's wrong with me? I just want to know what's really wrong with me, should I get help or something...I often think about myself like I'm a negative person. Some people describe me as cold as I don't really have any genuine reactions to anything just pure neutrality some even say I lack empathy. I keep most of my feeling and thought for myself and the only thing that's wierdly funny to me is dark humor and misfortune of others. My attitude on the outside, most of the times, is "I don't care", but when I'm alone, then shit goes down, anxiety, depression, dark thoughts you name it. I can go days without seeing anyone or speaking to anyone when I'm in this pit of my own making. But then again, I still have this slight need to socialise after some time. The thing is, some time ago, one of my closest friends asked me, what made me happy, when was the last time I was truly happy? And what worried me, I couldn't think of anything, still after thinking for like an half our, there was nothing. Don't get me wrong, I still laugh and sometimes even smile, but for me positive and happy people seem fake. Anyone in a similar situation? Some advice would be appreciated. I get angrier while running When my depression flares up (mostly in the winter), I get what I call 'the angrys'. As the run gets more intense, I start thinking the darkest, angry thoughts like a swarm of bees around my head. I hate everyone on the street and God forbid anyone get in my way. Usually running makes me feel good and it does later on but during the run, wow. That feeling of good at night, dread in morning I feel good in the evenings, planning etc.	1

This really lead to me questioning myself, I told my therapist and he said that I am depressed but I still feel like shit.... I just want to crawl in a whole and cry for a couple days. Tomorrow the world will go on like always I've never been here... this wasn't a part of "the plan" but I said why not leave something somewhere since no one else will be receiving anything. I have lived 20 years by myself, no relationships, no close friends, and the memories of being taken advantage of in my youth haunt me day in and day out. I run away through drugs but my depression is beginning to break through my facade of confidence. No one knows who I am and even if presented with a companion I don't know if I could ever explain the scars. I hate who I am and how I act, I feel though it's not even me. Social anxiety makes me act in ways I can't even understand and the repetition of "I'm okay" is getting old. I've tried to make friends but no one seems to want to know me and it's left me feeling like a sociopath. Insanity overcomes me as I scream, clenching a blade that can no longer quiet my mind. I've tried so hard to not be ignorant or selfish but I can't handle this anymore. The need of hospitalizations and psychologists remind me of the freak I am. I strive for perfection but am the opposite of it. I have so much love that I want to express but have no place to put it. I was raised religious but have so many doubts, my problem maybe isn't ignorance but overthinking, I hope... Nobody seems to understand subjectivity/relativity. There is much to be said but this will probably find its own void. I'm dreaming of a different world, but the oblivion of what I don't know plagues me. I leave my love and peace here, may you find yours.            "...because this is how things ought to have been and I know the worst of it wasn't all that it seemed, why can't I dream? do I care to dream..."It's all just a never ending struggle Life's a war. A war to find a job and to find a SO.  And a war with yourself if you can't find one those things. Life is crap.	1
Peace out. Just another night. Another night of feeling lonely and just wondering what I did wrong in life to deserve this unhappiness. I’ve never felt a pain stronger than being rejected by the love of your life. The person who gives you a purpose. The person who is supposed to make everything better. You would give your life for this person and they just don’t love you anywhere near the same. I began to openly discuss my depression to my friends. It was very painful to discuss but I think it's a step in the right direction. Up to now, I have never discussed my depression with anyone besides my husband and my therapist. I have slight PTSD from when I was kid and a teacher had been "concerned" for me by some disturbing behavior. I felt even more misunderstood and felt so much anguish that I became really good at disguising my depression. I hid it under a fake, likable, version of myself because I wanted to fit in and feel like I belong.	1
My psychiatrist just called me and told me she is terminating me as a patient and is unable to see me or refill my lamictal because I was prescribed Ativan by another physician.  I am freaking out about the effects of stopping this cold turkey.  I only took the Ativan for one week, two months ago.  I just want to have my lamictal refilled.  I need a refill this week, I can't find a new psychiatrist in time.	1
What I wanted to build was a simple web app that would let me score my productivity on a daily basis (based on exercising, reading, socializing, meditating, etc) and then plot that against my daily depression score. I wanted to see if there was a correlation between higher productivity and lower depression, or if certain activities had a greater impact on my mood.	1
Does anyone else experience this? Is this common? Whats the point anymore with love After nearly a year of struggling to stay happy from what happened between my ex and I and trying not to do relationships anymore, i let myself slip and gave myself a chance with this one girl who is amazing and nice and kind and such just to be thrown away after one fucken week. We work together and she liked me alot but since im a manager and shes an employee, we had to keep it a secret but people were already starting to spread rumors about us and my GM who wasntnearly as suspicious about it cut her hours and days for this week and i asked why. His response was that she was flirting with alot of other guys and it was becoming a problem so he cut her days to just 1 this week. When she saw the schedule she thought about us and how it was a bad idea to date and it wouldnt be a good idea anymore since she doesnt want to lose her job. Exactly one week of dating and I already lost someone that i didnt want to go away just like that. Like yeah im a bit sad but not enough to cry or anything but it just like, i was so fucken happy again i started to smile, something i havent done in months and it just felt nice but now im back to my depressed state of being lonely as usual and just play games, work and goto sleep and repeat that day after day until i end it all. This is why i try my best not to date or get attached to anyone because if i try to date, it will just end badly for me. I just want to be happy and have someone close.Will God Ever Forgive Me.!!!???? I wonder if God will ever forgive me.!!!! I’ve lost it all over and over.!!!! Hurt the feelings of my beautiful princess my beautiful queen.!!! All due to my own insecurities.!!!! I cheated.! And it all just hunted me.!! I would always think she would go on and do all of the shit I made her go thru.!!!!! I know I’m a fucking piece of worthless shit.!!! Advice for getting back in touch with everyday life? I think the hardest thing for me, and the largest factor I need to address to try and feel healthy again, is simply trying to feel engaged in and enjoying the present. Right now, days have little to no meaning at all, and I am only really able to think of my life in terms of weeks, months, and years. As a result of that, I feel nothing from the hobbies or moments that would before provide me feelings of joy, satisfaction or just generally fulfilling myself. The only activities I really "enjoy" anymore is anything that provides me with a complete escape from reality, however these activities are not exactly one belonging to a healthy lifestyle.	1
What I'm asking:	1
Recently, I was walking the streets in search for job opportunities when I sunk into a depressed mood and began thinking about my place in the world (which always turns out well). Nothing actually matters. We work in order to pay rent, in order to stay in the same place, so that we can reliably keep a job so that we can pay rent. It's in this meaninglessness that humans as social beings look to others for comfort. Our lives are but a meaningless speck in an expanding universe. That's quite the depressing thought... And it is. But why is it that when another body's lying on top of mine, or when I'm held in a warm embrace, this thought doesn't have any impact on me?	1
Up until now	1
about this time a year ago i️ went through a very rough patch due to depression, and it was one of the lowest points in my life. i️ slowly but surely started to get better, or rather, more numb. eventually i️ was ok. not happy, but i️ could function fine. fast forward to today and i️ suddenly dropped back into my depressed mindset. it’s as though i️ just woke up from a year long sleep, like i’d been going through some fugue state. it’s weird and scary but also familiar and comfortable in the worst ways. i️ feel so awful but life also feels more real than it has in the past year. i️m suddenly remembering all of my regrets and aspirations and relationships that i️ had just pushed down and suppressed and  it’s awful but also it feels like i’ve found a missing part of myself?	1
When I close my eyes and think of a memory, I just see grey mist or static like of a television. It doesn't feel nice not having anything to fall back on in your mind, things that made you happy. Am I the only one who believes in fantasies and lies to cope with not killing myself? I believe that one day, the girl I like will like me back. I believe that she will reconsider rejecting me, and apologize to me and we can be in a relationship as more than good friends.	1
I've talked about my situation with my family and they are trying to support me (I'll start therapy in September) but I can't help  feeling like a burden...	1
Like me for me and tell me looks don't matter. Please get to know me. Please.  Please.I'm gonna die a virgin. No one likes me and I have no friends. My masculinity, self-esteem, and sense of self-worth have been destroyed thoroughly and are simply nonexistent anymore. I don't even bother trying anymore, I just wallow in my own sadness and escapist entertainment trying to find a reason to continue living with the fact that I'm worthless. No woman would ever be into me and I'm gonna die a virgin. I can't even find solace in masturbation because whenever I see any sort of porn I go deep into a depression again because seeing two people enjoying each other makes me envious. I have no friends and now I don't think I can make any.	1
The treatment team could've been better. They were good to me but not to everyone there. Changed meds without informing me. I went from 5 to 10 to 15mg of Abilify. Good Lord I felt it once I was home. Then REALLY felt it when they made a mistake and I went cold turkey for two weeks because I couldn't get my prescription filled. I'll update once I'm properly back on it.	1
With love, B, 12/3/2017. Depression leads to procrastination and procrastination to depression. Please help me get out of this cycle.I kinda like being depressed after dealing with anxiety As a lot of people, I have both depression and anxiety disorders.	1
12.) When the time gets busy, I normally don't talk a lot. Again, I need focus on the job.	0
Have you ever realized you have no goals? Ever since i was a kid i had no goals. There were things i wanted but i didnt want them so bad i deal with the consequences of what it costs to obtain or experience it. It feels like im protecting my "little slice nothing".My mom asked me:"What held you back" Today I went down to the city,I walked around for a while I went down to the river and stood there for a while than I went up to the bridge and stared down.I ran away from home.I didn't have my phone.My parents didn't know where I was.We had an argument for at least 8 hours and I just had enough.I had depression since I was 9(I'm 15).My mom always said I was just imagining it.When I got home they started yelling at me(rightfully so,I was away for 2 hours they were about to call the police,but I had to be alone for a while).An hour ago my mother asked me why didn't I just jump off if I have a "missarable" life. All I could think of were these two things:1.I should have done IT 2.I was right about her Any comments? I'm a daca recipient and I fucking hate it. I was born in Mexico and brought to the US when I was 3. This of course means I'm one of those "nasty illegals" everyone seems to hate.	1
&amp;nbsp;	1
I can't wait. No where feels like home. I remember thinking when I was younger: “I just want to go home.” Even though I would be in pajamas and in the house that I grew up in. I feel like I don’t belong anywhere and I will never find my place. The future just seems very bleak as though nothing good will ever happen. I feel like nothing works or will work out, can someone relate? It‘s always like I try something and want to better myself, have high expectations and then life comes, uppercuts me, spits on me and just screams „You thought, bitch“.	1
I have a great job, and am just about to finish paying off all my loans, but I don't feel any accomplishment in that either. I keep thinking maybe I'll feel good when I have enough to put down a down-payment on a house, but I doubt that will be the case.	1
Fast forward to October 2017. This is where my current situation and problems begin. I am currently studying abroad in Japan- something I have been envisioning and looking forward to for 10 years. Honestly, I had been constantly dreaming about this for an extremely long time. It was what I felt my life was gearing towards, everything led to this.	1
Why it IS like a skinned knee:	1
Since I don't know what to do with my life and what career to study, the only thing I can is overthink. I know I'm young but thinking about the future makes me so anxious. The only thing I want is to be happy.	1
Recently I had an Uncle who I was close with get involved trying to help with my depression and anxiety issues. He encouraged me to go see a therapist again for the first time in years and was just there to talk and encourage. Then when he saw progress he started pushing more and more and I started getting really stressed. Then when I had a break down and started slipping back he took said some shit to me which really cut me deep. I stopped talking to him for a while after that. He said things that confirmed what I thought people in my family were thinking abou me.	1
I turn 18 next month. No job experience. I get my photo id next week. Its very late because my parents lost my birth certificate. Set me back a lot.	1
I wouldn't have known the true, judgmental, and frankly I have no fucking idea where in the ass of God did they pull all their judgmental shit - if I hadn't snooped and read text messages of my mother to other people. Hell, my own mother's in it, too!	1
I don't know what I'm working towards. I can't comprehend a world in which I don't wake up in an apartment that needs to be cleaned because I'm too tired and too lazy to do it or that I don't spend my time in a numb, self-loathing void. I don't know how people get through their days liking themselves or liking their life.	1
Yes my mom was a hippy and my dad's family didn't approve of her since she already had 4  kids when they married.	0
Watch the seconds, it’s a countdown,	1
I am in school. I finish community college this year and will move to a four year school assuming i can as my performance isn't amazing. I I want to pursue grad school to gain qualifications as an industrial/org psychologist, but everything seems so far away. I feel like with being a Psych major i'm just going to end up equally as useless with a four year degree, and even if grad school does work out, that's overall another four years from now. I have to pay bills, and i hate feeling so useless.	1
You’re done putting your interests aside just to receive love for the night/day. You’re done with getting angry at the phone for not getting responses quickly. You’re done feeling unimportant or unloved because you’re not someone’s first priority. In the month and a half since the breakup, you have transformed. It is only the beginning but you have taken steps in the right direction. Future B needs to look back on this whether she’s in a good spot at the time or not. She needs to know that even though she may not be at a point in life she envisioned, she did something for herself.	1
I have to say that moving here has been the most difficult challenge I've ever been through in my life. First, though my English is not bad at all, I'm SO, SO insecure about it. I'm feeling afraid to open my mouth and say complicated things, and it is depressing me. (I am a person who's talking a lot by nature. I've always been like that) And I feel like someone took away that ability from me and I'm much less charismatic in English than in Hebrew which affects my confidence tremendously... After smoking weed for 4-5 years almost every day in Israel, I quit doing it since the first month I got here only because it made me feel very anxious (it used to make me feel quite the opposite before)	1
But I recently saw in a youtube comment section one person said "I've been living with depression &amp; PTSD for 25 years, it gets easier every day blah blah blah blah..." and someone else responded "I recovered from depression &amp; PTSD in about 2 years... lmao"	1
It’s not the title, but a question that lingers on the back of my head every second. It’s a common trend that people live for other people but what do you do when you have no one to live for? I never had anyone to live for. It’s not a huge problem really, its another lingering question or jealousy I have whenever I meet a person. Every single one of them have someone who cares for them, even a stranger would care for them. It makes me feel jealous that no one would care for me or even bother to be nice to me unless I open my mouth and say I have cancer or they knew about any of my situation. People don’t care, they pity me. They realize, then, that I’m a hopeless situation and they can’t help me at all because they really can’t. No one can. Therapies don’t help. My therapist knows all of my situations are out of my control and he wants me to move forward with my life. It’s not really a bad idea, it’s the smart thing to do especially being someone in my situation. I just don’t know why I can’t. Every single being on the planet wants me to graduate already but my body doesn’t agree with me. It’s always either I’m too sad/ stressed/ depressed/ ashamed/ anxious/ lazy to go to school. Nothing helps. Not even the 30mg of Lexapro helps. My school counsellor is doing the nice “I get it, I understand” approach with me and it makes me feel better but it really does make me feel guilty.	1
Everything else about me was always very negative.Do you ever wish you had a god to pray to for guidance? Because I do. Whatever’s out there, if anything, please fucking help me. Give me the right words to say to my boyfriend to get him out of his slump, and please keep me from drowning myself. Please give me a sign or something. Anything. Amen.	1
And so here I am, still working, trying to fake it everyday, feeling like a house of cards thats ready to topple.  I'm afraid because if I go off work again that will have been 3 leaves of absence, and I really don't think I could show my face around here anymore after that.  I remember how horrible my life felt when I was on medical leave.  I remember falling behind on child support, having to borrow money from my parents.  I remember trying to convince my girlfriend that my low sex drive was because of meds and not because of her.  I remember trying to convince an insurance company that I'm sick, while simultaneously trying to convince myself that I can get better.  I remember feeling like a useless waste of skin that drained on the resources of everyone that dared to care about me.  I guess what I'm saying is I know, right now, I'm suffering from depression, and I'm afraid of what might happen if I admit that again.Do you ever get to the point where you feel nothing? I'm 19 years old and I should be able to go out in the world and talk to anyone and enjoy anything. However I can't enjoy anything and it sucks so bad. going to start therapy soon.	1
But you know what really incited and is still by far the biggest part of my depression? A girl. A stupid, uninteresting, normal ass girl. But I love her. I love being around her. And she probably doesn't even give a shit about me because she has a boyfriend. We hung out at a park and had a great time, we always do when we talk... But she's never the one to start a conversation and never offers to hang out. Okay, boyfriend, but at least let me be your friend. Just planning a meetup is such a pain the ass. I wish you'd just tell me to fuck off, but you keep saying yes. All while you straight up don't give a shit about me.	1
Just wondering if any else has the same feeling where it seems that a shitty day turned into a shitty month which turned into a shitty year.	1
I'm going to fail. And the worst part is that I'm passionate about this subjectI don't like when people ask "How are you?" Because instead of saying:	1
-just thought i'd share that in the hopes that it would brighten someone's day. I love you all, stay safe.I’ve been abandoned by anyone I’ve ever loved. My mother emptied the bank accounts and left while I was in school one day, 20 years ago. A few years later, my father followed suit, getting sent to prison and never contacting me again. My brother lives across the country, haven’t spoken to him in years. Sister actually lives a few miles away, haven’t spoken to her in months.	1
I don‘t feel like anyone deserves that anyway because they don‘t put as much energy into me as I put into them.	1
I'm afraid I'm frustrating him. I feel like I'm dragging him down. He's tried to get me to take better care of myself, but it's hard, seeing as we're long distance and I always slip back into my bad habits. I feel like I pissed him off tonight and I never understood why he got frustrated, but now I think I do. No matter what, I didn't really listen or heed his advice, and I'm afraid because of that he's going to decide that I'm unmanageable and he'll leave me. I'm terrified I'm going to make him resent me.	1
14th birthday: All my friends but one bail on me. My parents scream at each other until my mother packs up and leaves.	1
I came back home from my boyfriend's house because I think I should spend some time with my mom. My dad's death made me speak what I feel and even stopped suicidal thoughts. But today.... I decided to be honest about few things unregarded to my dad.  Now mind you, me and my mom has always had rocky relationship and I would never tell her much. Now I reminded myself why... Since my dad died I've been honest to her about my limits towards me seeing his corps the day before burial and I've been crystal clear that this Saturday I didn't feel ready yet to go to the cemetery and I assured her that I'll surely go one day. An hour ago she told me that me telling her all of that is avoiding all those responsibilities. I'm shocked, I feel hurt, I feel anger and... Hatred... One of my coworkers told me "don't do anything you have no strength for, don't push yourself, everyone grieves differently". She's the only person that understands me... I will talk to her tomorrow because she will understand. She's such a kind person... But not... I feel so weak and I feel like sooner or later I will kill myself because that's too much, I have no one to realistically help me besides good words. I feel like now there's nothing that will hold me. At least i want to be understood by someone. I won't get it from mom, I feel like I won't get it from boyfriend. Im too tired, I really am. Please someone believe me. I have no where to go, nowhere! Please.Went to a therapy centre for the first time today I hesitated so much before going, I almost went back too many times. I actually got the address wrong the first time and knocked the door on a young lady asking her if she’s the therapist at the address that I have. Anyway, I’ve filled out the forms and I’m waiting to be contacted by the centre, it’s scary and weird. Anyone else feel they are unloveable? TLDR: I feel I have no friends and anybody I get close to leaves	1
Not a flame of love, nor an ember of passion	1
I guess for example - I've lost a little over 30 pounds since February, the first significant time I've actually lost weight, and I'm now no longer medically obese... but I still just feel fat and haven't been able to feel anything good about the weight I've actually lost.	1
I'm sorry I let you down, your family down. I'm sorry I buckled. I'm sorry I didn't have the experience or the know-how to react to certain situations.	1
a concerned citizen Sometimes I wish I had cancer or something so people wouldn't expect anything of me The bottom left of my ribcage hurts like a bruise but there's no visible bruising or anything like that. Been that way for a few days. Here's to cancer and giving up boys. 🍻🍻I used to know exactly what I wanted to do in life, but now when I look foreword all I see is eventual suicide. My whole life I’ve wanted to go enroll in Animal Studies at NYU to eventually get a degree in zoology. It’s been my dream for as long as I remember. I was going to get good grades, get my driver’s license at 16, stay in shape, eat healthy, get married, have kids, earn enough scholarships that most of my college was paid for, and get a job that I loved. Basically be the perfect woman. But now, everything seems so impossible. I’m currently failing most of my classes because I can’t find the motivation to do assignments, which causes anxiety to wrack up even more than usual. It’s just been awful. Anyways, when I try to look foreword once again that my young, stupid self had planned out when she was little, all I can see is... nothing. I just want to be clear that the only reason I’m still on this earth is that I know suicide would crush my family. I want help, I really do, but my pride won’t let me ask. And even though I (temporarily) decided to live, the call of the peace after death still calls out to me. It reminds me of our past flirting through the angry wounds criss-crossing my arms and the knife bloodied with my own blood under my mattress. I just want, more than anything, for this pitiful excuse of an existence to end. Exercise will make you feel better! Is what everyone says. So I listened and signed up for a gym membership. Fast forward one year later, I've become *so* obsessed with the image of my body and being as thin as possible, I overexercised and underate, so on top of my depression, I messed up my health and I developed an eating disorder which is making me far more depressed. It wasn't supposed to be this way.	1
Finally, my 3rd year of college, I met the most amazing woman. With her help, I felt like I finally defeated depression. We dated for 2 years and I was so sure we were gonna last. However, I got a job on the east coast whereas we were both from the west coast. We decided we could last through the distance so I took the job and moved 3000 miles away. She just told me it wasn’t working out and broke up with me.	1
It seems like whenever I try to plan anything though, she isn't available, even if her husband is. I planned a surprise party for my fiances 30th birthday that I had been talking about for months--her husband was there, and at the last minute, she couldn't attend. He didn't even tell me she wasn't coming until he showed up without her. We visited their home on 4th of July weekend and there invited them to my parents house (they have a pool) for the holiday. He showed up, she didn't because she was "sick" (read: hungover.) Her husband showed up for an hour or so and she was continually calling him asking when he was going to come home and take care of her.	0
By my second year of college, I had reached my lowest point. I was in a toxic, emotionally abusive, relationship. I had a broken relationship with my parents, who spent most of their time stuck in a cycle of fighting, not speaking, and then pretending that they were okay. I hadn’t spoken to my older brother, a struggling addict at the time, in almost a year. I no longer knew who I was. So one night I went out and bought a bottle of wine with my fake ID and went back to my apartment and chugged the entire thing. I sat on my bathroom floor crying, staring at the knife in my hand. And in the back of my mind I thought about the gun that was a few feet away from me hidden in a book that my dad had given me for protection. For the first time in my life, I had looked at mortality straight in the face. I had questioned it many times, but it was never like that night. Eventually the crying stopped and the numbness came, a feeling I had become all too familiar with.	1
I’m just trying to make it to Friday. My favorite band is coming to my city and it’s the only thing I’m looking forward to. Its the only reason I am ignoring the thoughts of suicide...I need a break from all this bullshit.	1
I feel very often that horror stories are told of hospitals. In reality, if  you need the help, please seek it out. You may have a completely different experience than someone who claims they don't remember their stay and was drugged up to their eyeballs.	1
- I was trained for three or so days before being expected to run insurance billing, keep rooms clean and do therapies, and run the front desk.	1
-&gt; Pretend everything is just peachy	1
She asked me to explain further, but I couldn't find the words to better express that perspective.	1
But despite all that, I want to kill die still.	1
Stranger: life is all we have	1
I met this girl a few weeks ago and I instantly liked her. She’s the most amazing girl I’ve ever met. She’s funny, smart and so beautiful. We started texting/snapchatting. I told her I liked her and she said she felt the same about me. We started “talking” and we met a few times and things were going really well. Last weekend she stopped over at my house and we watched some Netflix and had such a good night with each other. I knew I was in love with this girl and I could honestly see us getting in a relationship in the future. After she left my house the following morning she started acting weird. I asked her what was wrong and she said her ex boyfriend was going crazy because she stayed over at my house. She then said she just needed to be alone for a while and that we should stop seeing each other because she still hasn’t properly got over her ex. It was so horrible, I started crying for ages and I couldn’t stop. I still feel so upset about it and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get over her. How can I get over her? I can’t stop reading our texts messaging of us saying we love each other. This is so hard. I’m crying again. Realising your mental state and life is unfixable sucks Just started to realise this. Been working my way to suicide last year but it didn't work out.	1
I struggle a lot with the fact 22 veterans a day kill themselves but I'm still around. I carry endless guilt that better people die and I'm still alive. Goddamn it. People are dying from diseases and cancers while I exist. While I can't so much as go outside without feeling like all eyes are boring holes into my psyche. I hate that all I do is sit here and lay in bed. I hate myself.	1
Do those who recover quickly look down on those who recover slowly or can't recover at all? Also is there any more information on why we all recover at different rates other than what I mentioned above?the beautiful things in life Light streaming through the leaves of a tree. The night sky, thousands of pinpricks in black velvet. Someone so beautiful they make you catch your breath when you look at them. Those songs that make the hairs stand on your arms. The only thing that keeps me alive is the beauty in the world. It makes time slow down just for a little, and stops the incessant flow of (mostly negative) thoughts. There's so much beauty left to see. It can be as amazing as the the clear blue waters surrounding a tropical island. It could be as mundane as a flock of birds flying in harmony over your roof. Sure, there are a lot of really shitty things that we go through, but there are those breathtaking moments you have yet to experience. Those moments where you think "damn, it really is nice to be alive."I’m so alone... I’m almost 20 and I’ve never been in a relationship before. I’ve only been rejected by 4 guys and 2 girls. One of them is my closest friend. He says that if I was a girl he would be with me. This makes me feel like I have to change myself in order to be his. Even then I still don’t think he’ll be with me. I’m in love with him because he’s one of the only people who makes me feel like I matter. I just wonder if I’m even going to have anyone in the future... Dating websites/apps are also out of the question because no one wants to talk to me no matter how hard I try. I'm winning this battle today I ordered groceries, pretty much all produce. I WILL NOT let them go bad. I'm doing laundry today. I'm showering today and brushing my hair. I just might even mow my back yard (not likely, but it's fun to dream)	1
I've simply lost the meaning of living. I have no self esteem, no confidence, nothing. Maybe people like me don't deserve to live a good life, perhaps we ought to die and just get over it.	1
I can say that I think of suicide somewhat less than I used to... so there's been improvement.	1
I‘ve been like this since 6 years old. I‘m 21 now. I don‘t know why I got thrown into this world when I‘m ridden and infested with mental illnesses. the message i wasnt able to send him. Dear ex, today I found out all the truth. I saw you with her. Why have you been lying to me? Why do you tell me you'd love me forever when you don't. Why did you lie to me that you aren't talking to your ex when I know you have been.. when I saw a message that you sent her that said "When I'm with her I think about you" that hurt me so much..I still forgave you. Why did you lie to me about her "suddenly" coming to see you when you already knew she was coming to see you? Why didn't you tell me you were going to see her when you told me you were out with your friends? Why do I still forgive you even when you keep fucking up? Why do I love you so much that I didn't mind if you don't love me as long as you were by my side? Why did you even tell me you would make it up to me and gain back my trust when you don't prove anything? Why do you keep telling me so much lies? When were you ever sincere to me? Was I a rebound? Are you happier with her now when you used to tell me she never made you happy? Did you get what you wanted now? Is that why you left me? Am I the only one dying here? While you enjoy yourself when we only broke up yesterday? Did I really meant nothing to you? When I thought you could love someone like me because I can't even love myself. I depended on you and you destroyed me. I gave up everything for you. My dreams, my friends, my family, my time, my efforts, blood, sweat and tears for you. Maybe it's just my fault for not being good enough. Maybe I wasn't pretty enough for you? Maybe I was right.. she was irreplaceable after all. I knew it.. no one can love me. I am not mean't to be loved. I am so capable of loving someone so much but that person is always not capable to give the same love. My heart has been torn apart again. When I trusted you so much with my fragile heart. When I prayed to god you weren't like my previous ex. You became like him.. except you were even worse. Why promise me things that you couldn't keep? Why tell me that you love me when you never did.. I just hope that all the memories we had together, at least just one tiny part of it was sincere. Where you actually loved me and was genuinely happy. I'm sorry again that I was good enough to beat her. I hope you and her will stay happy and be together forever. I just really am never mean't to be loved.I feel like culture is a big reason why a lot of people don’t seek out professional help I don’t know much about other cultures, but I live in a Hispanic/American household. I feel immigrants’ families are typically a very work focused group. They expect you to just tough it out and push through everything . Most people in these communities don’t see depression as an illness, but rather as an excuse for being lazy or unmotivated. There’s almost a macho type mindset that you aren’t supposed to talk about those bad feelings and that shit really sucks. It’s pretty much frowned upon to even consider looking for therapy because it’s “for crazies”.	1
But whilst I was away, she decided she missed all the drinking, drugs, and sex she was missing out on.  She wanted to live with her friends (who she actually hates living with at times), and countless other reasons.	1
Wish i had a gf. Everyone rejects me =,=	1
I imagine it as being this huge struggle with myself, almost like a character in a movie or a book and glorify the worst parts of it to provide myself with any comfort I can. It's pretty toxic but it's one of the only ways I can deal with it, does anyone else find themselves doing a similar thing?I hate myself, just a vent, going to delete I don't even want anyone to read this. I guess all I ever wanted was for someone to want me around. The only way that's probably even possible is if I'm useful at anything. Problem is I am a grade A screw up.	1

Yet, I cannot stop thinking about her.  She has me broken, in ruins... even my faith has been hit hard. I don't understand what changed.  I don't understand she did what she did.  Why did she play me for so long just to hurt me?	1
As you admitted this morning, to yourself and G, your sense of clarity evaporates when you begin to feel vulnerable. It leads you to a self-fulfilling prophecy - the exact neediness you exhibit will do the exact opposite of what you’d like it to do and will therefore lead you to feeling ever more “needy.”	1
\- We haven't had sex in a week.	1
Any help would be very great. Not fearing any consequences for our actions? "Not fearing any consequences or not fearing anything" is one of the feelings I have observed in myself. I am not able to study well, yet when test comes, I have no fear of the consequences of the failing tests, even though I am certainly failing it.	1
I don't know. I checked myself in to a Mental Hospital I decided after dealing with months of annoying suicidal ideation that I should go to a mental hospital. I say annoying because I was aware of these increased thoughts and wanted nothing to do with killing myself. While I wanted a closed environment away from home stressors to solve my issues I was also afraid of going somewhere unknown. I went through with it (despite crying and feeling emotional on the way there) to get my life turned around.	1
I finished my studies (not by working hard, but because I was good at it) and put all negative emotions into working out. I got accepted into a difficult job at the Army. Now I quit the Army because of an injury in my knees. At the same time I lost a girl, even though we only went on one date, I thought she could be the one positive thing to take from the Army and all the hard work I put in to get into the Army.	1
Depression usually comes in episodes for me, and a lot of people I've talked to. Sometimes I'll be doing okay, and then have a really bad day, or even a bad week.	1
I had to go to the emergency room as well when my fiancé was here due to yet another kidney stone. I got one in the 7th grade, near the end of my exchange program and one in a restaurant where the pain was so bad I needed to call an ambulance... more money on shit I can’t afford.	1
Stranger: gotcha lol	1
I’ve been depressed since age 8, my first suicide attempt was at 11 and I’m convinced my life will end by my own hand eventually.	1
For some reason i feel like im not designed to have friends, that my life should keep going on the PC without real "friends"Am I crazy for wanting to get back with her? So let me give you guys a bit of a timeline first:	1
I know what he did was horrible. It makes me sick to my stomach to think that I was there and couldn't help. It makes me throw up and stay up at night knowing that I stayed with him. On the other hand, he himself is absolutely sick with guilt. He's been having non-stop anxiety attacks, crying spells, and moments of catatonia and he can't stop saying how horrible it was that he did that and how he wants to be a good person. I believe he is genuine and my first reaction is to make sure he gets treatment so nothing close to that ever happens again. He checked himself into a psychiatric ward last night.	1
Knowing that the girl went through so much hardship just to chase the dream I stimulated her from her youth gave me so much hope at the darkest point of my life. Knowing that I had the capacity to influence a big change in a little girls life gave me the purpose to live. Even though I had to wait for 8 years for this news, it was worth it.	1
...When I had to write a very apologetic post four minutes before it was due to start, deflecting to some bullshit like "personal stress + shitty time management." And just like that, I had disappointed everyone involved.	1
I mostly have had off and on friendships through recent years. Mostly the story is: I start talking to a potential friend, we quickly find a bunch of similarities and similar humor, become close really quickly, they become avoidant/ distant/ flakey (or in a recent case - manipulative) and I get upset and end the friendship. I’m quick to forgive and a HUGE pushover, and people really take advantage of this and at some point, I realize this and that’s when I get upset.	0
Today is the day!	1
Depression is the exact same way. When it happens, you know what you should do to handle it. The best way, backed by science and research, is what we've all heard countless times: Exercise, eat healthy, do something nice for yourself, clean your living space, listen to happy music, watch TV shows that make you happy, etc.	1
Stranger: do you workout?	1
- April 2017 we met at work, became really good friends. She still had a boyfriend, but broke up with him about 2 weeks after we started hanging out.	1
I'm depressed constantly. No matter how happy I know I should be or how wide I smile I'm in the grey of storm clouds that seemed, at least until this subreddit, to be only over my head. I've had so many jobs that I just explosively quit. I've got Intermittent Explosive Disorder as well as depression and anxiety. So I coil up and wind tightly before my brain dumps chemicals that make me explode with no regard for the damage done. I'm currently unemployed. I left my last job like that. I loved my job. I loved the guy I worked for. I earned several raises within a few months and was promoted quickly because I threw my back into that work.	1
Money isn't evil, it is a resource. It's power, you can use it for good or bad. I want to become a billionaire. You can save and dramatically change 1,000s of peoples of lives with that amount of money. I'd rather have that power than someone who doesn't have that perspective.	1
Stranger: do u do drugs	1

Should I pretend all is fine?	1
Good Bye everyone. I hope you've all had an awesome day. As for me everyday is the same and if things don't change soon I think i'll rather end it. Not even graduating college meant anything for me. I fucking hate myself! I feel doubts about my relationship when I'm depressed? I'm 25/M. I'm gay and I've been with my boyfriend J for five months.	1
Due to the unexpected costs we’ve had, I can’t afford to see the psychologist, that’s why I’m posting here.	1

Wait... I forgot I no longer have a passion for things anymore. I'm so alive outside, but I'm pretty much dead and rotting on the inside. I wish I'd die already. Fuck.I don't know what to do with myself anymore. Last year, I met a wonderful friend online. We began dating in February of 2017 and have been inseparable ever since. However, we both have mental illnesses, for me I have PTSD and depression, and for him ADHD and depression. He's being treated for both, I'm untreated because of my family and our financial situation.	1
This is probably terrible but I've got too much free time and my mind being idle is very bad.fuck. so my ex who I miss like a lot and who moved away because she hated me so much is apparently coming back next year and...	1
Also -- if you think I should do the audio thing -- do you have any advice on what to say and what not to say? I'd really appreciate it.	0
I’ve been severely depressed for the better part of 2 years at this point. It has totally disabled me, robbed me of a career I loved, and made most things difficult or unbearable. I’ve tried 7 different drugs to try and get it and my anxiety under control. No cigar.	1
In all of this, I just really really wish I could quit trying to be an adult and go back to the days when I believed my mom when she said she loved me, I want to go back to when my dad wanted to help me talk things out so I could figure out what I was doing. I want to be able to call my mom up and tell her that I feel like a complete failure and that I can’t add to see my therapist and that I need help talking the darkness down. But if I call her, she’ll one-up me because I’m the biggest mistake of her life. Or worse, she’ll tell me that I should try (fill in the blank with whatever bs Facebook depression fix is trending). I want to be able to call my mom and say hey, I got another job and I’m excited. I want her to tell me that she’s proud of me.	1
You: so yeah what is your last piece of advice/Last words?	1
I liked waking up early and going to the gym on an intense pre workout.	1
You: yeah	1
i've always been this ugly, boring fucking unwanted piece of worm shit. my dad cheated on his wife with my mom. i knew he had left when i was young but i didn't know i was a mistake until my uncle told me, in so many words, the 'truth' about my birth, and how i'm lucky to be alive, and how she prolly should've aborted me (i was a spoiled, shit kid and he was trying to get my attention. honestly this story isn't even a big deal, though i did break down retelling it once. i'm filing it under just being high at the time). i kind of ruined my mother's life. kids never liked me either. in general, people only like me when i'm in full 'social camouflage'. i'm nice, witty, assertive, all the traits of normal folk. as soon as that camo starts to thin, and i start doing all my stupid retarded fucking worthless mannerisms, or sounds, or daydreaming, or opening my mouth to talk naturally about anything i want to at all, i'm outed. i've had my entire classroom laugh at me, more than once. my own friends, even by original bets friend, would make fun of me and call me ugly. i mean, again, nothing new, but just to paint a picture of whatever i guess i'm sorry	1
I started noticing I was always unhappy and sad in my last year of high school. I didn’t understand the point of life anymore and everyday driving to school I just thought how easy it was to drive off a cliff on the way to school. I got scared and told my parents who helped me get professional help. I confided in my 3 best friends at the time and almost immediately I noticed 2 of them stopped talking to me. The third I’m still friends with but not nearly as close as I used to be.	1
Unfortunately for most of us, the type of physical and emotional intimacy that we strive for is unobtainable. In my life, depression's caused me to push away the people that I've spent time building connections with, and has limited the amount of contact I've had with strangers and people that I COULD connect with.	1
2. This one was recent. We live in different countries. She texted me, after not speaking for three days due to busy schedules, about how I’m lucky to not have a health issue. I thought she was just upset with her life. But she was evidently mad at me. She made it seem like I don’t deserve my Masters degree because I didn’t work as hard for mine since I didn’t have to overcome any health issues. The worst thing she said was that I keep bragging about my life, but “nobody cares about you.” She tried apologizing maybe five minutes later but I ignored it. She somehow assumed I wouldn’t be angry. After many texts, I told her that I was upset and that I needed space. She got upset that I was upset about what she said. Just because you are sick and your life feels like shit, that doesn’t give you the right to say something like that to someone and still expect to be friends. Two weeks later she told me how my happy posts were annoying her and she hated it. Blocked her without replying.	0
Society "requires" us as citizens to go to work pretty much every day to pay for living expenses and food. It's a fucking bitch and I don't feel like I'm cut out for it, It's fucking hard for me and I have absolutely no motivation to go to work everyday just to survive	1
Also every fucking motivational coach and self-help guide is a fucking scam. Focusing your goals, working hard and putting effort in to achieve them? Yeah, tell that to people with terminal diseases or people living in poverty without the chance to ever get better, people dying of famine or living in war zones.	1
For background, I have a scholarship for tuition for the next two years and I'm terrified as fuck that I'll lose that if I get a course load reduction. Also, my parents basically don't know what mental health is so there's no way I can talk to them about it.You cannot be whatever you want to be No matter how hard you try, if your goals are too high, you will not achieve them. You will never be a famous athlete, or writer or successful businessman. All you will ever be, is a beast of burden for this sadistic, torturous farce that is life. I know that, now.	1
My mum is suddenly rushing for me to get Centrelink (welfare), so she can take half of each payment. We barely have food in the house most days because she uses her welfare on cigs and bills.	1
It was rough. My co-director continued to do little of anything, and I felt like I was juggling grenades. I couldn't fuck this up. Kids I'd been mentoring for years needed this camp to cope in a healthy way, and for a number of parent couples, the week of camp was the last time they got to spend alone together before one of them would pass away from cancer.	1
I've been so good lately; Been through this long enough I know why I'm like this. It's February. And February always sucks. Is it possible to fake depression? I have been feeling bad for about 7 months now. There are periods where I cry on a daily basis, I never feel like talking, I struggle concentrating and collecting thoughts, I feel such an extreme sadness inside of me also in happy situations, I am exhausted all the time even if I sleep 10 hours straight, I often have headaches, I am completely alone and I find it difficult to do anything. There are nights where it’s unbearable. I think about my situation: I am completely alone, I am failing at anything because I am so weak I can’t handle my feelings, I feel guilt for everything that happens around me, I can’t carry on anymore, I am always here in this dark place and I feel that I have no right to be like this. I used to self harm and I still have many scars on my skin, but I think to be disrespectful to those who truly struggle then I promised to cut never again. I shouldn’t have the right to do so. My life is void, I am void, and I can’t get the energy to do anything ever. I do not get pleasure from what I used to love, nothing seems to make me feel something good. I can enjoy no series, no book, no videogame like I used to. I think I don’t even deserve to eat. I am just trying to pity myself giving myself depression, but I don’t have it. Is it possible to fake depression? Could it actually be an excuse for me to not take responsibility of the failure that I am?In the mood to vent So I'm gonna make this self deprivating post quick. I was a sick child. Shit was fucked. Too young to understand what was going on and had lots of surgeries and what not. I possibly have autism, I was diagnosed with sensory processing disorder to get O.T. however I think they gave me that so I wasn't stuck with the label of autism. I think they believed I was too young to be diagnosed and so I never got a checkup from a psychiatrist after O.T. . So it's possible I'm autistic but idk. Anyway my childhood was shit. Absolute fucking garbage. I was the loser kid. Had physical issues so I never left the house. I was ugly and fat. My entire childhood was just a big fucking waste of time. Anyway I become 16 and start hanging around bad kids. At this point I lost all fucks to give about my schooling. My social skills were finally developed enough so I can make friends but I didn't really like any of them. I started getting a prescription for drugs. It wasn't very difficult given my medical history. Started taking Adderall daily. And my mom would occasionally give me some Xanax she had. Also started drinking. I guess some warning signs for a shitty life but idk. I'm not entirely sure what to do at this point. I plan on going to community college since I'm probably gonna drop out of HS soon. I just don't think I'm ready for the real world. I always feel like I'm that one person who just can't adapt to things.Back to square 1 Depression sucks. I have Been depressed for longer than I could remember. Some days are okay, I could manage to get out of bed and go out. Some days I just want to shut myself in my bedroom, lying on my bed. And then I feel useless and ruminate over the fact that I am in fact useless. Today I feel like absolute shit because the weather sucks. No I am not going out of my home. I don't care if I am running out of food in my apt. I am forgetting all the advice by therapist and wiping out all the progress I have made. I am back to square one. I am such a useless existence on the earth Alone It’s been so long since someone’s actually made me feel okay. It’s been so long since someone has genuinely made me laugh. I get more high strung, anxious and depressed every day and everyone around me reminds me all the time. Living is becoming a chore. Does anyone actually feel a little better with the recent Trump/Putin headlines? I live in rural Trump country and work at a gas station. Suddenly nobody wants to talk politics, and my regulars and coworkers have starting acting more civil toward me. I’ve long since shut up with facts about collusion or anything related to the news cycle, but it’s nice to finally have the other side do the same. Regardless of your politics, it’s nice to no longer be a small community’s object of scorn.I think you guys might understand this. I was walking with a close friend after having lunch together, and I told her, "I feel as if I'm living on borrowed time."	1
I'm an alcoholic and so is she, so we drink together a lot.  I certainly would be able to quit if I didn't have to drink to be around her.  Besides the booze I have no idea what other drugs she's into; I know coke for sure, probably smoking crack time to time, she's made jokes about wanting to go out and do meth all night.	1
They specifically hired me saying that they weren't looking for someone to just stick for a year and move on; they wanted to hire someone and essentially keep them/train them eventually up to management level in the course of hopefully a year or two depending how well I take it. I said yes... though, mostly out of seizing a good opportunity.	1
What took you to this edge? What made you so desperate, To take such drastic action?	1
Since this subreddit is brand new, feel free to offer any suggestions that you may have. How to help my mom make friends? My parents have had a rocky relationship since I've known them, some times worse than others. Over the years, my father's caustic conversationalism and other factors has caused my mom's friendships to fade away. She's been quite depressed in the past couple of years, although in a slightly better frame of mind lately.	0
I’m a 17 year old high school student. My best friend is 17 too, (Who will be referred to as Golf from now on) We didn’t even know each other before the school year started, but we had a couple mutual friends and we just... connected. It’s one of those friendships where it doesn’t really make sense, to anyone, let alone either of us, it’s like we’re family. It’s the only way I can describe it.	1
Exercise and the lot don’t work - in fact I’ve exercised 30 minutes or more every day in the last 1.5 month - after all I’m not a young person, I don’t do very strenuous exercise and my metabolism is probably low. So exercise itself can’t burn off the additional calories I’m consuming.	1
Some of the things I’m thinking of telling her are:	0
Be strong, you wonderful people.Nausea/heartburn from Wellbutrin I started about a week ago and was having some reflux beforehand but only really when I drank alcohol or had something really acidic. Now I’m avoiding all that and I still have issues everyday. I know heartburn is a side effect but the weird thing is that I take it right in the morning and then at fine all day until the evening while I’m getting ready to go to bed I’m just hit with bad nausea out of no where. I avoid eating before bed as well.	1

17th birthday : Dad starts an argument in the middle of a restaurant in front of my best friend. After we get home, the argument continues, resulting in my dad physically attacking my mother. All while my friend and I sat in my bedroom."	1
I don't ever feel like telling them for they will propably assume I'm ungrateful and spoilt. I've had everything! They sent me to school, fed me, put clothes on my back. What else could I possibly need?	1
EDIT 2: THANK YOU SO MUCH TO EVERYONE! You are all such awesome people. I cannot express how thankful i am and how this has been my best birthday in years, i feel like a kid again. i have not smiled more in the past years. It brings tears to my eyes to receive so many thoughtful messages and support, all of you are just great! Hearts of gold. Thank you. Thank you.	1
If it was cancer they would cry a bit and buy me a drink and say 'how tragic' when I finally go	1
I've had depression my whole life and I've always gone through episodes. Sometimes they're mild, and I'm just generally down for a few days, sometimes they debilitating and I can barely get out of bed for weeks. I've also never had a lot of friends. I don't have casual relationships. I either don't really think of you a friend, or I love you with every part of my heart. There's no middle ground.	1
During high school I woke up and started to try again even though it was really hard. Since then I haven’t stopped. I regularly do thing I don’t want to do in an effort to make it by. I get up at 5, I shower every day, I go to the gym, I do my homework, study, etc.	1
Or should I let depression win?	1
Or should I simply just go all in?	1
And being told to go to clubs by my parents. I just feel more of a disappointment when I tell them there’s nothing I’m interested in and that I also am too afraid to still be alone when I join one. I’ve done everything I could in my life to try to fit in or make new friends, and there’s a reason why I have no motivation to try any of these anymore. And then they say it wouldn’t hurt trying. That couldn’t be any further from the truth. If I try to fit in again and still don’t have anyone to talk to, I’m gonna hate my life even more. It’s like I’m trapped. I can’t do anything to please me. One day I want friends, then the next I don’t want anybody at my school to bother me because I know they don’t really want me to be there friend.	1
And also I don't really know how to feel about this. I think it's important to be humble and I never want that to change about me. But I am going to become very wealthy. I have a certain perspective on money.	1
being cyberstalked by a uk kid 😢 I have some 14 year old kid from the UK that has been cyberstalking me for the past 4 months on my twitter, Facebook, YouTube and other social media accounts all cause we had a fallout over a wwe 2k video game (yes seriously). I've been trying to block him but he keeps making more accounts telling me to kill myself and that noone cares bout me. he has told me to shoot myself in the head with a gun, drink battery acid and tells me that my friends on PlayStation are no life's for supporting and putting up with me. He also hacked into my friends YouTube channel a while back and took it down thus causing me to have to delete my main YouTube channel and lose a majority of my videos due to him threatening to do it to me too. I can't contact law enforcement as they don't seem to care and he even went so far as to make a fake girl account on twitter and try flirting with me to talk to him. He's making my life a miserable hell. And my personal life isn't going much better either 😢😢😢Want to cut but can’t I promised my girlfriend I wouldn’t self harm but last Friday I tried but I started panicking because I remembered what I said and she would see the cuts. I gave her my box cutter on Friday and today I started looking for something else in my room and I don’t have anything. I’m going to my schools counseling center with her today.Does anyone else's depression causes them to constantly daydream or imagine their lives are a documentary? I daydream a lot about people I know in real life or situations I wish would happen. It's alternate reality I go to escape my loneliness. I sometimes daydream about being in a hotel in some tropical paradise or being in a very romantic date or just that I'm in some kind of reality TV show/documentary where I'm the star and the narrator at the same time and everyone admires me. My mental state worsens once the daydreaming is over and I realize it's just fantasy. :/I feel like a hypocrite when I try to help my suicidal friends Do you guys wish a different sperm hit you me mother’s egg. I think there is other sperm much more deserving of living this life than the sperm I once was.Yesterday was my birthday and no one said happy birthday to me My parents even forgot and I felt so alone :( I turned 21 tho :DI wish people that have never experienced depression could still understand. There are those who might really care about you and want to help but they have zero clue how depression works and their mindset is basically to tell you to get over it because that's what they do. It's so fucking shit. I should be grateful I have people that care about me I know, but its genuinely not that helpful when they brush aside how shit I really feel because they don't see a reason for me to feel like this other than just being weak. It's not even their fault it's just actually uncomprehendable to some people that you would rather not exist sometimes for reasons beyond your control. Why is it that any physical illness gets so much sympathy and empathy from everyone but the second it's a mental issue theres no excuse for it.I miss my mom... Ever since I was put into foster care, all I ever wanted was to bring my family together again. I wanted to build a future good enough to stay with my mother again.	1
Yet I cannot accept	1
No anti-depressant works for me. Every medication makes me miserable and sick unless it is a stimulant, and I don't want to be stuck on stimulants. I used to drink as a crutch and now I can't.	1
I feel like I have massively screwed myself. Most of the time now I think about what I could have done differently in high school and what my life would be like now. I honestly hate everything about myself and wish that I could just go back and make things right in high school. I want to get help, but I also don't I don't want to stay like this forever. If I do I'll end up killing myself. I don't know what to do to get help, given that, while I live on my own, I'm not on my own health insurance and I don't want my parents involved. What if I did get help? The doctor would probably run me through a variety of medications that could have bad side effects. I read one time about a guy who basically lost his sexuality because of an antidepressant he got put on. What if something life-altering like that were to happen to me? I'm afraid to risk it.Ready to just say "fuck it" I can't take it anymore. I'm an atheist democrat living in a family of hardcore christian conservatives. Ive made it clear that Im a democrat, to which they just call me a snowflake all the time, which just makes me resent them even more. I dont dare tell them Im am atheist, but Im thinking about it. I dont have anything to live for anymore.	1

I'm being ganged up on by everyone in this house, and their relatives, and every single one of my relatives. I once questioned if I was the one at fault. I mean, if EVERYBODY hated you, you're probably doing something wrong. UNLESS, you're just that damn unlucky and every single one of your relative is a fucking asshole. I've heard of those stories before, so it isn't impossible - and I think that's the case with me.	1
But, this is life and I need to work. No choice.	1
I still feel like garbage	1
I‘m good at pretending nothing bother‘s me and everything‘s fine. I‘m good at pretending to say „Wow, your advice helped me so much, thank you for listening!“.	1
But other times we'll both be in a good mood, and the spark is totally there, and I feel great about everything.	1
I can’t afford a therapist, and the ones that have been recommended because they work with your income are awful....	1
She didn't speak to me for two weeks.	1
You: haha so why don't you choose the second option?	1
Stranger: friends probably	1
Secondly, if I were to be gone, who would feed my fish? Nobody would, they’re like dollar fish. They’d die and then thirteen other lives would be on me.	1
Why?  Because she no longer wanted to have my baby.	1
I just want to enjoy the things that I used to enjoy, but whenever I try I feel like I am wasting my time, are not doing them well enough. Has anybody gone through something similar, and has advice for how they managed to get through it?	1
Today is your birthday and I yearn to hold you and keep you safe.	1
- September/October 2017 she told me she's always been attracted to me, but wasn't ready for a relationship. I was in love with her at this time, after knowing her for a while and her being everything I want in someone. Suggested being FWB, which I took her up on. But whenever I tried to make a move on it, she didn't seem to want to do anything. We hung out just us 2 every day, would always be talking, but for some reason when the time came around to make a move she never seemed to want to do anything.	1
I always hate myself because I feel like I lack a lot of thing. I have a social anxiety where I love being alone, I feel nervous when talking with someone else. I avoided my highschool friends because I think I cant fit well. I am afraid to talk in front of the crowd, I am not able to express myself well. I hate that I am incapable to defend myself sometimes. I feel self loathing. I wake up every morning feeling the same thing, feel I will never accomplish anything. I see some of my friends are married, have their own cars and good jobs. I am stuck here and doing nothing. I cant be pretty like them and I dont have money. That is it my life. Ever get to that point where you don't care anymore I'm 18(F) and I live with my partner and his family 18, my parents have been kicking me out since I was about 14, but my mum kicked me out a few days after New Years and told me she didn't want me and I was better off dead.... I was a carer for my mum I look after her. I've been placed on antidepressants that they've been trying to place me on for years but couldn't because of my age and I've not spoken to my mum in almost a month but she phoned me last night and I thought it was to sort it but it wasn't she was phoning to tell me that I'm to pick up my stuff otherwise it's going to charity.... everyone says it's better I don't stay with her anymore but I don't know part of me wants to no matter what pain my family cause me. Is it because I love them or because I don't know any different.  I feel like I'm running out of options to stay a live... I don't know what to do anymore... I give up and I don't know what to say or do anymore.... maybe this is how it's meant to end...I don't know how I'm gonna do it. I'm 27. I lived alone, had my own stuff, my own life. I gave up everything to join the military. I went to live with my parents again until I left for boot camp.	1
My goal has always been success. Ever since I was a kid I daydreamed of owning a mansion with fancy gates, a huge lawn, a big pool. This was always my goal. I wasn't going to accept living in poverty like my parents or having an "average" life. So I worked hard for it. I was always top of my class, I was on the dean's honor list in college, I started (and failed) my first few businesses, joined clubs, went to a lot of events to meet people, and landed an internship. I was even in the middle of starting my next business. I also got my credit score up to almost 800 and started funding my retirement/investment account.	1
A cause could be that i have worked on a lot of projects during the past 3 years.	1
Idk what to do. I’m trying to find reasons to live but am falling short. Help.Generic vs. Brand Name Lexapro? Has anyone noticed a difference?  I went with generic lexapro due to not having insurance currently, but is it the same thing?I feel like I dont have control over any of this So, unfortunately Ive been depressed for as long as I can remember... I have major depression, GAD, PTSD (sexual and verbal abuse) an adjustment disorder, and up until recently, an eating disorder...I used to be on meds... They stopped working... Then I was hit bt a car... Lost two  close people in my life... Moved colleges....Then i was in therapy for a long time... My therapist died... And then i lost my job... No more therapy for me..	1
No one checks in anymore	1
I say it’s bullshit.Am I Depressed or is it something else? This seems like a dumb question because to an extent I know I'm depressed but not to a clinical level. Like I hate the situation I'm in. I hate being in debt. I hate living where I live. That sort of thing.	1
Why I'm posting this right niw: I somehow convinced a girl that I'm not a complete idiot, and we're together. Since she's ill, I thought I'd swing by and give her a little "get well soon" kit with soup, tea, chocolate, that kinda stuff. All that came back was a half assed thank you, no comment on anything in the damn thing I've planned for a week now. I didn't expect much reaction, since she doesn't seem to like spending time with me anyways, but a little more would have been nice. I guess I'm just bad at everything I touch.	1
Does anyone else relate to this? Does anyone else relate to [this?](https://m.imgur.com/a/KeSMV) I feel my life is so boring and goes nowhere (and in circles at the same time), just as depicted in the photo.Most people on here seem to be so much more successful than I am and i'm really happy for them! it's just that it makes me feel all the more worthless that i never had a job, a girlfriend/boyfriend, i don't even really have friends, and there's probably some other stuff but i cant remember it rn. sometimes i tend towards these goals bc i hope it'll make me happy, but there are so many people out here who are so successful, who "have their life together" when you have an outsider's take, but who still are not alright. really, what's the answer to life (that's rhetorical, i'm just venting, but thx for reading i guess).i dont enjoy anything anymore the only coping mechanism is used was gaming but i dont even enjoy it anymore. i dont know what to do idont really enjoy anything else.I Just Want to Feel Normal I’ll try to make this as short as possible, I swear.... And please bear with me. I know this is overwhelming and a lot is jumbled, but I have no other outlet....	1
I really miss being a kid when I could pretend that my world wasn’t on fire or that I wasn’t drowning.	1
I don't know what you're supposed to do with this information. I just needed to tell someone. I can't relax at all anymoreI finally got antidepressants I finally bit the bullet and saw a doctor about getting some meds because my life is in shambles lol. 2018 is looking pretty alright.	1
The reason my depression has returned is because I feel trapped, mainly due to my living situation. I would consider my upbringing to be the low end of middle class, and yes I realize there are people much worse off than I am. I grew up in a family of 6, 2 parents and 4 siblings including myself. For the past 18 years we have lived in an 1800 sq. ft.  town house in California, right off of a busy street. There are 2 rooms in the house. The master bedroom is rather large, I would estimate about 2.5x as big as the other bedroom. Up until a few months ago when my sister moved out, all 4 of us siblings were sharing the smaller room. Now there are 3 of use sharing it, but still two bunk beds taking up the same space. There is absolutely no space, and I am 6'3" tall and do not really fit into my twin size bunk bed. My mom has kept the large master bedroom for herself over the years, and has forced my father to sleep in the living room, despite the fact that he is the one who pays the bills. She is a selfish person. My desk, which is where I try to study and work, and where I spend most of my time, is in the living room. My dad is usually in the living room watching TV, and there are lots of noise and distractions from other people and the kitchen etc.  which make it nearly impossible to study or just relax.	1
I've been hurting myself since about third grade, mostly from scratching myself with my nails until it leaves a mark for a few days and hitting myself on the back of the head. It's extremely satisfying and I feel like it's a good thing to punish myself for being such a waste. So that's pretty much the gist of it, I guess? Mostly just problems with self worth and having others view me a certain way. There is some other stuff, but nothing that I can really think of at the top of my head. These past 3 months have been excruciating, and I haven't gone a day without thinking I should just end it all and give up. I want to be happy, but that just seems so far away and I don't know if me living benefits anyone. Admittedly, I don't want to die, but I *do* at the same time? I feel like I have no place in the world and I can't talk to anyone about how I'm feeling because none of them are actually willing to hear what I have to say, so now I'm just dumping my feelings on Reddit. I'm tired of living and feeling like shit. I don't remember the last time I genuinely felt happy to be alive. I want someone I'm close to tell me that they love me and care about me and say I'm not a useless piece of garbage and that what I say isn't meaningless or invalid. I don't want to feel alone. I don't ask to feel alone. I feel alone because I am alone, and I feel like I can't tell anyone this because I don't want them to walk out of my life.	1
Stranger: like anxious/depressed thoughts	1
Having a rough week. Just want it to pass. Did your mental health get worse post secondary? So I’m in grade 12 right now and I’ll probably be moving out and onto a uni campus (if they accept me hopefully) and I’m honestly pretty nervous. I’ve been clean for a little over a year now and I’m terrified I’ll relapse and without my parents and dog with me it’ll be even tougher. So yeah how do you guys cope with a whole new environment and being away from home? (Also any advice on uni in general would be helpful)Today I made...banana bread muffins! Getting my fruits in right? They are super tasty and just like last time, I'd love to share with y'all!My depression has gotten a lot worse recently and now I can't do my schoolwork. my head just gets super foggy and I feel exhausted. What do I do? I used to be a straight A student. It's like I'm watching my life fall apart in slow motion and I have no control over it. It's only a matter of time. I wish I could have done things differently I graduated high school in June of 2015. Currently I am attending community college and have been doing fairly well so far although I don't know how long I can keep it up. Back in high school I didn't try as hard as I could have resulting in lower grades thus barring my chances of getting into a four year university. Freshmen year of high school I saw my lowest gpa ever I had gotten a 1.8 gpa in the 2nd semester of that year. Hell I was dumb enough in my freshman year to think that I could get away with cheating in my ceramics class but I ended up getting caught. If the university applications saw that I got a D in an art class they would have thought I was a full on retard for trying to apply to a university. It was because of my second semester of freshmen year that I thought my chances of a four year were impossible. I also never bothered to do the ACT/SAT because I thought that with my low gpa it wouldn't have mattered anyway. The following years in hs I've managed to improve a bit but not all that much.	1
Remember when i said that i have tourette syndrome, well i always told myself that it also does have a "mental" side to it. I can come across different then the "normal person", or use the wrong word in sentences to express myself. And i interpret things differently at times, i usually need to hear the explanation multiple times and they have to explain it very clearly. My parents just said im a slow learner but with "hard work i get there". This fucked me over so many times in life, and whenever i tell people/friends about the mental side of tourette they all have that expression on their face. The face of "ohh that explains alot, but i also feel so sorry for you". Im so fucking sick of it, im not even sure if this happens becuz of my tourette. Im really starting to think this is just all in my head and that im just retarded. (my iq is average tho). I often imagine myself having some disorder to make myself feel better, i really dont know what to do with myself. I feel like an absolute loser who cant even think like a normal person. Last 6 months i bought myself a nintendo switch + some games to cheer myself up. it gets me trough some days but in the end i still end up having no energy to get out of bed.	1
The thing is the people that I am around are understanding and they haven't made fun of me ( till now) but I haven't become one of them because of this so should I pretend to be cheerful or continue to show how I feel?	1
Tonight I landed my first kickflip from the street on to the curb. I've been skating for about 10 years now and never been able to do that until now. It may not seem like a lot but it's a challenge that I've faced with fear most of my life. I'm so happy right now I have no one to share it with so I thought this would be the best place to share it with. I normally don't feel happy anymore or generally feel content but right now I do and I want everyone to share something that they're proud of or something that made them hopeful or brought them comfort in a time of misery. I want to kill myself a lot these days I’m just so disconnected from everything and everyone. I can’t meet new people, and it is making me hate my life. The only girls I meet are through work, and I’d rather keep these relationships professional. Girls I meet other ways never last, and I don’t know how to stop talking to them. I’m always holding onto the shred of hope that we will pick up where we left off, when I know this isn’t going to happen.	1
Fair enough. As I was driving home from work today I was thinking about who to take, and I came up blank. No one came to mind. I have my roommates, but I don't really talk to them much and they all have girlfriends that they hang out with all the time anyway. Even the ones I went to high school with. I realized the other day when they mentioned it in passing that they had started a new DnD campaign with a new guy. I'm never invited to dinners or anything anymore. We never make a big ass meal together on Saturday anymore. Honestly, I don't think they'd even want to go anyway.	1
Do you ever desperately pray every night to wake up with  brain cancer	1
I feel alone. And worthless. Im not successful and im worried ill never be. I dont know how to solve any of this. this sucks my crush asked me to make this photo of her... I'm totally destroyed now. why would she have done that if she knew I was in love with her. JUST WHY? https://imgur.com/a/qMS7SAre my struggles even legitimate? [rant] I have been wondering that for a long wile, after a friend told me that there life had been worse so I had no right to be the way I am.	1
Sorry for the rant haven't taken my antidepressants today yet.I had a fight with my friend I just had a fight with my friend and its all my fault. Now he doesnt trust me and crying in the shool bathroom stall doesnt help me anymore.If I killed myself no one would care or know Post graduation depression is real. It's been 5 months after graduating from college and I've never been depressed more than ever. Unemployed and feeling worthless. Parents are forcing me to get a job already, Peers landed their dream jobs / found a job that pays well and earning more money than me. The feeling of being worthless is overwhelming. Crushing. While unemployed, I've finished a free short course on graphic design and got my certification after passing the assessment and currently doing one on web development. I want to learn more skills in order to land a good job. But I don't think my parents would understand, as they want me to get a job already, any job (Customer Service Representative jobs are a trend in our country which most of fresh graduates end up, I'm not detesting that kind of job but it ain't my thing). I'm depressed more than ever. Fucking anxiety. I've been avoiding my  peers because I don't want them to see me unemployed and broke. I'm anxious because I don't think I'm worth it and anxiety had been a problem for years. I'm depressed because of the pressure my parents are giving me. I'm mad because nobody understands me. I'm sad because I don't have anybody. I'm afraid because I might end up a loser in the end.  I'm a mess because of the all of the above.  (God. I sound like a whiny bitch on my first post here on this subreddit.) Anybody else feeling like me? What/Should I do?Do you ever? Do you ever sit there and go "what the fuck is wrong with me" because obviously something must be wrong with me for people to not want to talk to me. I know I'm not the most emotionally upbeat person but it's hard to hide how you feel all the time and sometimes I just want to be able to tell someone. I am losing myself HELP ME OUT To start of, i am such a loser that i flip out on people which include my own friends, siblings and parents, most of the time i am depressed because i dont have anyone else to hangout with.All i seek from this platform is all the help i need to be better. Little bit of background of me, I live with my parents and i hardly have any friends except 2 close ones. I feel i'm losing my only close friends because of my extreme behaviour such as getting into unnecessary fights, causing some sort of misunderstanding and blaming them for absolutely anything.Sometimes i am too caring and sometimes i am too rude. I am struggling with addiction to porn because i have no other option to make me feel happy. I have an on and off relationship with my parents and siblings because of my unpredictable behaviour. I have lost interest in life. I have lost myself. Maybe soon lose whatever i have got left. But i believe i could get better if i could get some help, maybe some of you could help me out with how to deal with the struggles i am facing.	1
I feel miserable again today and I'm just running out of steam to keep going, I really don't know what to do anymore.. I'm exhausted from constantly forcing myself into uncomfortable public situations but at the same time my home feels like a prison.. I have nobody to talk to or gain support from anymore, the couple of friends that I have all have their own lives with wives and kids and my family has been out of my life for 10 years and for good reason.. I know nobody has answers as to what I should do but I just needed to rant Things not funny anymore? Not sure if anyone else can relate to this but it seems as of late I don't laugh anymore. When I watch my favorite channels on YouTube I just sit there silently, not laughing like I used to. It's weird because these videos used to be my release but now it's a chore to just get through them. Does anyone drink daily? Worst year of my life. I used to cut myself and alot of other destructive things(i've more or less stopped those things). Things getting worse. Im trying to get better/improve but I just want a way to cope and feel better. Theres no need to suggest anything else. Ive either tried it, wont try it because its not for me, or due to my circumstances cant do it. I thought I could just start drinking again. Atleast until things get better. Im confident that I can stop if/when i need to im just thinking about the health effects. Atleast i'd legitimately be happy while im drunk so i'd rather do that than say cutting myself or od'ing on medication. My First Real Episode Hey guys... I just really need to word soup to get things out that have been on my mind that I have not shared with anyone close to me, I feel as if this is the only way to fight this feeling of sadness.	1
I should be grateful for times spent with him, five minutes should be the best in the world (he’s so self absorbed I’m only worth five minutes every few months)	0
3: Another friend of mine and Abby’s (it’s a trio friendship) asked to hang out (her name will be Robin). Abby didn’t come which I was kind of glad about, so it was just me and Robin. We walked around town and all. It wasn’t even very late (6:00) when this one group of guys (4 of them, 18ish) hollered at us from their car. At first we thought it was a prank, but it kept going. They did this multiple times, following us or looping back around to greet us. We were getting freaked out. So, when they loop back around again I’ve had enough. I yelled at them to F*** off.	0
And that’s it! Last but not least, I want to thank you for reading this far. I really encourage you to text us. Moreover feel free to copy and paste this message in any other forum: the more people that read this, the more people we can help!	1
Well... it’s not nice. Not nice at all.	1
I don't know how to reach out to him, he didn't respond to my text message and the last thing I want to do is shove him deeper into isolation. Please give me any advice you can on how to go about dealing with the situation. I love him so much and I want to support him, but I don't know how.I'm having a good day. Taking the advice of others in this sub, I'm going to try to remember how this feels. And try to remember that it is possible to not feel sad, even if it's just for a day and the happiness is slight. I hope to remember this so that when I'm down the sadness tunnel again, things won't look completely hopeless.	1
I also took anti depressants (Tianeurax if anyone knows that one). At first it helped me, especially with processing feelings.	1
See you soon!	1
Losing connection with family members due to my questionable morality.	1
Edit- i spelled klebold wrongA song of fire and ice Hey everyone. I'm on mobile so pardon my typos which will happen. I'd like to take this time to thank anyone who reads this as well as giving a shout out to anyone currently struggling with depression. I have a long history with Type 1 Bipolar Disorder. Although that isn't necessarily depression in itself patients who are Bipolar are bound to eventually oscillate into that emotional polarity.	1
I really wish that I could see my therapist this week. I really need help making friends I'm 25, living with my parents. I recently quit my job, hoping to ease my depression but it only made it worse since I have nothing to distract me now. I lost touch with all of my high school friends after graduation, and didn't make any friends in college.	1
All this time, *it was me.* Sure, it was other people who planted those seeds, but it was me who perpetuated it, who told myself that they were true. After all, if you say something enough, it might as well be as true as anything else.	1
I missed my uncle a lot, but doing favors for his wife and kids helped me at least feel like I was contributing. My mother's still kind of a mess about it, but she has my father for support. My brother had a hard time for a while too, but his job keeps him well occupied. But, lately, for me, the things I can help with anymore have been fewer and fewer.	1
However, she is so messed up.  I have to say that now. I do still love her, and that will probably never change, but she needs professional help, and my mistake was thinking I could help her.  She was my best friend after all.	1
I don't feel like I'm living anymore. I'm just in a holding pattern. I think back to what my life was like, even 8 months ago, and I mourn for it. At least I'm not suicidal. I think I just need a place where I can come every so often and unload my mind.	1
I got a call from my dad. My childhood dog had to be putdown. Bone issues.	1
In that time i discovery somethings new about her (with 100% sure before you ask) : 1- She did sex for money , even when she knew me and just talked to me back then. 2- Her ex was a asshole that was aprisioned . 3- She lied as fuck to me about almost everything, her life, her family (like "my dad is dead" type of lie), her past, her path.	1
We began dating a year and 2 months ago. He's been nothing but the most supportive and kind partner I've ever had the honour of dating. Very caring, remembers the little things and is very physically affectionate. However for the past 2.5 weeks, he's been incredibly hot and cold with me. The worst instance having been on Thursday (4 days ago).	1
So we watch the movie and about midway she leaves, I assume to go to the bathroom but shes gone for about 15minutes and I'm just sitting there thinking "she wants us or one of us to go check on her" but I wanted to watch the movie and I didn't feel like putting up with her drama.	0
Anyways, how are you all? I've been more moody lately which is both good and bad. Good because I've usually just been soo numb though.	1
Finally, I met A [18 M] last september and we started dating in July. And he has been the most supportive person i have ever met, would take days off of work to take care of me when I was too sad, would help me talk through things, told me why he loved me and that the flaws didn’t matter to him. He is the absolute best and I haven’t even thought about suicide for the past three months.	1
Have you been through this phase?Why am I like this? Sometimes I feel really depressed, i think I'm at the lowest of my life and I can't do anything productive, I'm so tired. And, like, an hour after, I feel like my depression isn't real and that I can do anything and I feel good and see all the things I can do to feel better. But, not long after that, I fall back and I'm so tired again. Is anyone else like this? On the Verge of a Mental collapse Hello everyone. I hope we all make it out of depression. I just want to post my feelings at this moment. It feels as though I'm on the verge of a breakdown. My life is in a very sad place. My parents are trying to keep upbeat and are hoping for the best. They know of my anxiety and depression. My mom drove me today and I didn't talk at all because I was in one of those moods I get in. I love my Mother a lot and she is very dear to me. I want to get out of this and become someone, but it is very hard. Anxiety has suffocated me and I'm afraid to go out in public due to feeling awkward and confidence issues. I have been crying a lot because I have lost hope in myself. When I look at pictures of myself or my family happy, I get emotional. The years are flying by me and I have no way to catch them. I see everyone around me getting older and I'm getting extremely saddened by it. My anxiety prevents me from going out in public and I waste away my days. My life is a mess right now.Thank you to all who read this and I hope the best for you all. I can’t sleep. I know that if I go to sleep, I will have to try to find some bullshit reason to get up in the morning. Anyone else just get set off into a spiral of bad thoughts from simple things like daydreams or a text from someone that seems like they’re irritated at you? I start spiraling out of control into these negatives thoughts so often from even the smallest daydream that immediately turns corrupted. I was in a good mood working today and suddenly I daydreamed about the wrong things and now I feel so heavy it’s hard to work. I clocked out early just to get away and get into bed and I don’t know what to do. How do you guys handle overthinking? just typing this out makes me feel better but what kind of exercises or routines can I use to just calm myself..?	1
I’m still on school break, cannot really occupy my mind by going outside to meet friends or take a part time job or just walk around due to anxiety and psychosis, and all the things I used to watch/do to cheer myself up (music, slam poetry, writing, youtube, netflix, games) I have associated very strongly with him as we have very similar habits. So anything that could make me pass the time makes me sad.	1
I’m trying to not let it affect me and not hit a low point so I hope sharing this relieves me a little bit. I am nervous about sharing this though. I’m just shocked that someone could say that.	1
My SO keeps telling me to “take small steps” but that’s what I’ve been doing for a year now. It’s not working. I’m stuck in a cycle of waned to be better and “woe is me”.I find myself searching suicide methods. I can't seem to bring myself to actually end it.  Though I love fantasizing about killing myself, from sitting in my car with the garage closed to overdosing on heroin.  I hate my life I am a failure I haven't accomplished any goal of mine ever, I've lost all of my friends, and I spend all day everyday on my bed.  I want this shit to end but I'm to much of a bitch to kill myself or get off my ass and fix my life.Do you ever feel you're not cut out for society? I recently got a job working graveyard shift at a grocery store, it's not "hard" work per say it's just tedious as fuck. Shifts are 8hrs long and I'm making minimum wage. Most people would like to have my job it's relatively simple and easy but I feel like shit every time I come home from a shift.	1
I’m so tired of living. I’m not suicidal by any means, and I’m not talking about ending my life or anything, but I’m so TIRED of living in the mental state that I’m in.	1
Sound familiar? People just want to end the tedium, the suffering of being conscious.	1
My older brother is severely depressed &amp; was prescribed Zoloft. he offered me a one &amp; i took it in the late afternoon. i felt more outgoing, him &amp; i hung out. The next day, i went to work &amp; was doing an outstanding job with my performance.  i didn’t mind being at work. after i had a break at work, i ate a bagel &amp; then i was in the GREATEST mood ever. i was so happy. a customer even called me out for being so smiley, but i couldn’t help it. i cleaned my entire house, i applied for Spring classes for school &amp; even was thinking of long term dreams of becoming a lawyer. i loved how positive i was feeling.	1
There is no one path to overcoming depression, and sometimes it’s not exactly the cure-all you envisioned but rather learning to live with it. But I promise you all that one day, it will be better. You will be happy again. And until then, I’m happy to listen to you if you ever need anyone to talk to or have any questions.Why does seeing other people happy just depress me more? It just seems that when I see other people at school in the hallways or in class with their friend, they're always happy. I just watch from a distance with my music playing, looking at everyone. Shouldn't I be happy for them? I need a friend It's hard to put words to my feelings. I struggle with sounding serious and not coming off as an obnoxious dick. I'm sick of people coming and going and I've grown to hate myself. I don't ever act like the person I am at heart, and I never really have to anyone. I want to get out of this shell. I haven't had friends for years and I've posted here numerous times on alts and my previous account with no reply. I wouldn't be surprised if I get overshadowed by someone with much more clearly obvious issues than me like usual, but if you care, please leave a message. I hope you read this.What kind of things do you want people to tell you? Whenever I reach out to someone about my depression, it seems like they never tell me the things that I want to hear. I usually want someone to protect me, to hug me and tell me they’ll help me every step of the way. I’ve never gotten that though. What do you guys want to hear? I’m wondering if it’s different for everyone and maybe that’s why we never seem to get the right reactionWhy I’m leaving When I was a kid a had an accident in which I chipped both my front teeth. I was 12 back then, so my dad had the funds and everything but he never wanted to take me to the dentist which went unnoticed for 4 years and just a chip on my tooth became a huge problem, I got a gap and they look uglier than they did. Anyways the thing is just right when i was going to get the work done my dad got deported and I stayed by myself. I’ve been depressed since a kid because of this and my face is actually pretty but my smile is really bad, and is a big cost to fix them since I have no sort of insurance. and I got into this big mess. A long distance relationship for almost a year now and we haven’t seen each other and I don’t want to because he doesn’t know, his name is Ricardo. I’m 17 now and I feel like committing suicide would be extremely selfish and I would hurt him and my family but there is no other way I’m not happy with myself and it is what it is.Anyone have severe anger with their depression? Any good coping strategies? I'm about to see my first therapist this week for anger management and depression. I'm about an inch away from ruining my 3 year relationship with my angry outbursts and tantrums. I'm not in a real sunny place right now. Tired of being lonely but there’s not much I can do about it. I just want to feel like there’s someone to talk to out there but, no one in my life ever wants to talk with me about anything except to yell at me or to tell me to do something. That is the extent of my daily social life. I could probably go a month without saying anything or talking to anyone and no one would even care or notice, I need social interaction like anyone else, but what do I do if I can’t get it? I can interact at work ok, but that’s not really the same. Online interaction isn’t really the same either.Has anyone tried Trintellix/Brintellix? How long does the initial insomnia take to go away? I just started the drug and I slept terribly the first two nights. How long does it take for this side effect to subside? Can’t get a job. My patient is about to die. I’ll be out of a job. Can’t seem to get any hospital to hire me as a CNA even though I’m qualified. Had an interview cancelled on me. Can’t vent to my boyfriend or my mom. They make me feel worse and argue with me because apparently I’m just too negative and I’m not allowed to be sad. The depression is getting bad again despite heading into spring and warm temps in Arizona. Can’t keep doing this. The black clouds over me have been here my whole life. I’m sick of it. Just want to end it all. Fuck this life. The one upside of being depressed I've recently noticed something that has, strangely enough, somehow helped me a bit with my depression.	1
Well, i stopped to take drugs to feel better , i stopped with almost everything and started to go to gym and for now that is working, i'm just hope that someday in the future maybe.. Kim would become a nice person and will try to retake all the time that she is losting. Someone give me something to live for I just need something.	1
Maybe she'll do better.  I hope not.  But I think that's normal.	1
Last week me and my gf of 10 and a half months broke up, i was devestated. In that little time I have experienced more love, more of life than ever before and it felt like we'd been together forever. I thought, maybe we would work things out on our own and get back together when the time was right, even though i knew it was a stretch, but i was also okay with just being friends if that was what the world had planned. 2 days after the break up im talking to both of my best friends who are also (kinda?) friends with her, and they both tell me that she basically told them she had absolutely no intention of ever getting back with me because she wanted to ho around without the commitment of a relationship. She also openly bragged to one of them that she had cheated on me multiple times during our relationship. This all made me very angry and on top of that hurt. The same night just after finding all of this out I find out from my other friend that she had called her and bragged about hooking up with this one kid who, during our entire relationship, she told me she hated and that we BOTH already had bad history with, and fooled around. Then later (AGAIN) she goes on instagram live with my bestfriend who is kinda being fake just to see how she really is and openly brags about blocking me (which added to the hurt cause i had done nothing but try to respect her wishes since the split in hopes that we could at least part on good terms ya know) , saying that i was 'fucking crazy' and that she never wanted anything to do with me ever again. There's more in terms of details but thats the basic general idea of the past week for me.	1
Fuck life, it's full of crap. If there would be a suicide pill I would take it right away, but I would make them suffer. And who the fuck would care if I die beside my parents? Man fuck this. I'm so tired. So tired of everything.	1
Just as the tittle said , is it possible or i'm just seeing it all wrong?	1
I can not drink because I'm underage. This sucks.Life is a really fun party. And I'm standing outside peering through the window.She stopped texting back Hi, i'm 19 and for as long as I remember I have always struggled with self-confidence and my depression. I rarely use tinder because I don't match with many people, I'm below average looking like but it doesn't help swiping for ages and rarely getting a match.	1
Wearing a badge upon your head saying I’m “bipolar” is self deprecative as you’ve surrended your mental factilites and human experience/emotion for the NIMH who’ve admitted you can’t define “mental illness” and want to use you as some priori for the campaigns to sell treatment therapy and drugs.	1
I feel like I'm becoming a bigger burden on those around me. I think I'm just not built for this world. I understand not everyone is, but I'm starting to come to terms with it and I'm getting really close... real close.	1
If got a few new things to bring up to my therapist in two weeks i guess...	1
I think about all this as my fiancé and I talk about having kids. Both of us are ready and we want to be parents so very badly, though I haven’t brought up my fears to her. I worry often about passing on that illness to our children. My fiancé doesn’t deserve that, she shouldn’t have to face those hard challenges. I love her so much and the thought of doing that to her kills me inside. I feel so much shame around wanting to be a parent because of this that I wonder if I should be one at all, or rather, a biological one.  It’s something I’ve never really thought about before now and I don’t know what to do. Please helpConservative republican parents &amp; liberal arts educated democrat child...what could go wrong? I grew up in a poor household, but was able to use this to my advantage to get scholarships to private school and an elite liberal arts college. After graduating from school and coming back home, I realized that I have absolutely nothing in common with my parents anymore. They do not understand the concept of privilege, think everyone on welfare is lazy, voted for Trump and defend him and every time I get legitimately pissed off at them, they say that the school I went to brainwashed me and made me crazy and in doing so they completely invalidate all the hard work and effort I had to put in not only to get into this school, but working two jobs while there and still maintaining a 3.5 GPA. I was a sociology major, too, so these issues are literally what I spent most of my four years studying. It's now at the point where I cannot have a conversation with my father without it blowing up. It gets worse by the issue and the WORST part is that they are decent and loving people. Is there anyone else on here who is in a similar situation? What do you do? I'm slowly losing my mind trying to argue at this point. And moving out is the obvious solution, but I don't just want to run away from people who disagree with me and like, I don't pay rent.Toddler learning videos on youtube. Sometimes, we take long commutes in the car with our toddler. Especially, when one parent is driving we let the little one watch videos on the iPad as to not become a distraction for the driving parent. We got one of those iPad holders for the neck support. Now I'm on the search for good toddler learning videos.	0

Stranger: maybe its just a loop of thoughts?	1
I swear everyone on this website assumes we do nothing to try to help ourselves. I really can't believe people are that misinformed that they really think that many people choose to be that miserable. You wouldn't choose to be miserable if you had the choice, and so would we. But we don't get that choice.	1
The exhaust fumes made her tired, and in her tired stupor, she thought she could sit outside and freeze to death. She had a bottle of heart pressure medication as a backup. I thank my lucky stars that she fell asleep in the grass instead. Her attempt was unsuccessful.	0
DAE stop telling people things because you feel like you’re a burden I’ve come to the brink of my very collapse and I refuse to say anything about it to anyone around me because it comes off as attention whoring and needy. My anxiety and depression has gotten the best of me again and I’m stuck in an endless loop of worry and self-pity. I’m closer to giving in than ever. What have I become?Anyone depressed in spite of good life circumstances? A lot of people here are depressed for very good reasons. I really don't have any. I'm pretty happy with my life set up (of course there are some things I'd change but on the whole it's good).	1
A blue flame lit, reminiscent of what I'm lacking	1
All this just made me realize that people don't kill themselves, depression kills people the same way cancer does. People who haven't struggled with this can't even imagine what is living with depression and often blame a person who is basically ill.	1
So I ended my career, the only thing I've wanted to do, before it even took off. Luckily, it was more of a "this isn't working so we'll forget it happened" type deal and my enlistment ended without anything terrible. But I never recovered. At least back then I had some sort of tenacity. Now? I'm a fucking shell, mate, of what I was. A completely hollow individual.	1
I dont have any idea what to do with my life. I dont have any special talent or skills. The only hobby I really have is video games, but Im horrible at those. I've raged so hard at Battlefield that I broke down in tears and drooled everywhere, and anytime I play an RPG I restart so many times that it makes me not want to play anymore.	1
I hope you guys can relate.   I had a date on Saturday. It went great unfortunately. I have a friend that I'll call H. I've known her for 2+ years now and I really like her as a person. I recently discovered that she was interested in dating me, which boosted my self confidence so much (because who would be into someone like me). Well a week ago I worked up the courage to ask her out on a date, and this Saturday we went on one. It was great. We went to a small local coffee shop and sat there and just talked for almost 3 hours. It was seriously such a good time. On the way out I asked if she'd like to do it again and she said yes. Awesome!	1
When we get back to home , i say to Kim what her aunt has spoken and she started to cry (and i was worried) and telled me a story (that isn't even worth bring it here for u guys) that in fact was another person who beat her daughter.	1

Escapism isn't that great, and I'm so tired of feeling bad all the time.My grandma is dying and life doesn't stop So I work full-time and go to grad school part-time. I'm busy 7 days a week between work, class, and homework/housework. Normally this is a very good thing for me as it keeps the depression and other mental illness at bay.	1
So 1983, after a couple years from last hearing of Johnny, my mother and her family receive news that a body found overdosed in a park four months prior, belonged to Johnny.

Meanwhile in my life i'm struggling between choosing to go off to college or getting a full-time job. Only just a week ago I was getting ready to start to apply to FAFSA in preparation for actually starting college this year -- now with recent developments i'm not sure if that's even a viable option. I'll probably need to stay home and help out by getting a full-time job since both me and my brother are reliant on my dad financially, and my brother is already in college.	1
So, i'll be alone this weekend. Earlier today, her boyfriend came up to me and asked if they could "do the deed" in my house this weekend while my parents are out, he knows of my situation as well. They both want this, they practically begged me. I told them i would think about it.	0
Life is constantly going to try to bring you down.  When you fall I wanna lend you my hand to lift you back up, as l believe you would do the same for me.  We're all brothers amd sisters here. When life pushes we need to stand together and push back.	1
I have absolutely no idea if any of this makes sense at all to anyone, but fuck it I’m hitting the submit button anyways.Hate Once I've been counting my calories down to less than 500 a day. Now I've become fat and disgusting and I feel my belly hanging over my belt. It's disgusting. I hate myself so muchHow can I be happy if I have no friends? I'm in my first year of uni and everything has gone to shit. I have friends, but they never want to hang out with me. I ask, and they just ignore my texts or say they're busy. I know everyone is really busy in uni, but I take this so personally. I feel like no one ever wants to be around me. I try so hard to be nice to everyone and it seems like they only return the favor when it benefits them. I try to be my own friend and spend time with myself but eventually it just makes me even more sad. I don't understand why I don't have friends. I've joined clubs and put myself out there and it just doesn't come together. How do I not let this bother me? How can I keep from being lonely when I am so, so alone?Doing things that I like reminds me why I don't enjoy doing them anymore. Playing your favorite game? You shouldn't. Remember the time you shut yourself in just to play it endlessly? When nothing else mattered but your game?	1
It helps me literally be in another world for a while and forget about my problems for a while and feel like I’m living another life for a while. It’s not a cure obviously for depression but it does seem to help me a little temporarily.	1
But all this damn negativity...Jesus.I stay up late at night because I know the sooner I go to bed, the sooner I’ll wake up and have to start my day. And in turn I get less sleep which makes my day even worse, great. Thanks depression.I just love sleeping Just getting in my covers and wrap myself in a blanket. Everything's dark and my body's resting. I wish I could be there all my life.	1
You're actually being responsible and starting work early? Wait until you feel like nothing is worth it anymore.	1
I had a period of intense depression in which I went on a one month drinking binge and went to a hospital where I was given Ativan to deal with the withdrawal.  It wasn't a consistent prescription, just enough pills to ween off the withdrawal and ensure I wouldn't relapse back to drinking.	1
(Also I'm taking a lot of melatonin but it still doesn't motivate me to actually get into bed.)My life is so hollow Stupid self pitying rant, sorry. Nobody cares about my existence.  I’ve never been and can’t get into a relationship. I’m stuck in this isolated suburb for the next 3 years of my life, drifting between my school and home. Usually I can occupy my mind with focusing on my looks or dreaming of the beautiful life i’m going to have once i’m free, but recently i’ve been having to do more school work (i’m used to just stumbling through school without really focusing and getting above average grades but recently i’ve been having to actually work to compete with my peers) and I either reject it to stay in my dream world or get 10 minutes in and break down because it gives me time to realise how hollow my life is. Nothing feels authentic when i’m here. There have been beautiful times in my life and 90% of them are when i’ve been abroad. I just feel so genuinely empty whenever I give myself chance to look around and realise how isolated I am from people and the world. And as a person who truly appreciates the beauty of human beings and life, this really hurts me. " I want someone to be afraid of losing me. No one has and I don't think no one ever will " When I'm sad, I browse through sad lines/quotes. This came up, and I've been feeling this way for a long long time. I'm unwanted, nobody ever wanted me, nobody ever said that they need me in their life. I feel useless, I feel I don't matter. I don't mind being alone, I don't mind anything. It hurts though, knowing that I'll never get to know what it feels like to be loved, hugged or to be held by any one. It's  3am here, I can't sleep, I'm crying and this is how it's been for a very long time.I feel alone Hi I'm writing this here because I feel as if I have no one to talk to but it's occurred to me that I'm never truly happy with my life.. I'm 19 a male at that I've seem to never be happy as hard as try to be it never goes as planned.. I have no idea the root of my problem or problems I've tried a number of things plenty of options were given and I'm just getting deeper and deeper in a hole. I'm in a house with my mother and my sister but I feel like I'm in everything I'm in alone. That's what I hate the most . The loneliness How are y’all doing? Just honestly asking.	1
I have no care for myself at all anymore. I hate myself more than any other person. I’m selfish, impulsive, lazy, stupid, and above all less than worthless. If I wasn’t born I’m sure my family would be much more happy.	1
One thing i didn't mention is my role in all this. Im not sone big wig commander with tools at my disposal.  Im a newly promoted Sergeant and a squad leader with just a handful of guys under me. The one we just burried was not in my platoon, but i knew him enough to be deeply saddened by his loss. The other three were guys i was close to back in training, but i was not currently stationed with them when it happened. In fact i found out about all three of them on Facebook.	1
It legitimately feels like it should be Christmas by now... I wish I was joking.My hearing, attentiveness and social awareness has been completely off since dropping into a very low depressive period as of late. Normal? Walking through a busy shopping center today and I feel heavy and zoned out. I ordered food at a bakery and could barely hear my voice as I spoke. I didn't hear the employee very well and unknown to me like 8 high school kids entered as I was browsing and I didn't even notice until I visually saw them.	1

And now, I’m back. I’m ready to kick the chair, I’m ready to pull the trigger, I’m ready to jump.	1
When he has bad days, sometimes he likes to "check out of the world". He also feels that opening up about his struggles might be too much of a burden for me. But we had a discussion before wherein I said, I understand that you might need space, but let me know if you're having a bad day, and you're not in a chatty mood. Not sure if this was the right approach, but this was the time before the therapist and after we learned that he had to be away for more than a month. And for the most part, he's been open with me.	1
Note: I know there are people who have it much worse. Homeless, disabled, etc. I realize that and that is the main thing that I try to think about when I feel depressed and anxious. That I have it better than some people. But this is just my personal situation I am trying to deal with. Gf dumped me. I have nobody else I don't have anyone to turn to. I thought I might be able to somehow get through life because of her but now I have nothing to live for. I feel like I'm going to breakI feel like I haven’t done a good enough job of enjoying my childhood. As someone who recently turned 18, I feel like I’ve started the next part of my life and given my childhood a finite end. I wish I wasn’t like that but I just feel less and less connected to the kid I was as every day passes. What’s the worst is that I feel like I might’ve missed the best part of my life and wasted my one shot to enjoy it as much as I could. Idk I really just want to hear from actual adults who have gone through something similar and know how to keep in touch with their child side. ❤️Fuck everything I have to swallow a lot of pride to let people know what a fucking mess my head is. I'm so fucking sick of everything and i feel like a child cause I'm here ranting and asking for help from a bunch of fucking children. HOW? How do you live with the pit? The darkness? The fucking typhoons of hate and hurt? I've lost both my brother and cousin to this.... I'm fucking 20 and i yet I don't know how the fuck to cope with these demons inside my very soul and they say it's home. I don't want them to have a home in me. I have picked my was off the floor a hundred fucking times.... I've had friends interupt my attempts and atm I wish they handnt because that was before botb my cousin and my brother ended it. Maybe if it had been me they would stay around the way i am because i can't do that to mom all over again. I have fought so hard to get where I am but what the fuck is the point if when i fall I fall like this every damn time? Yes... I will be happy one day.... I know it gets better.... but fuck does it get worse.... how long till the monsters inside get too big? When does The ocean of toxicitisty that is my mind swell too deep and become to tempestuous for me to swim? God i feel like I'm  a fucking clown with a sad smile that people laugh at. I try so hard to claw for life when i relapse like this but what is the fucking point? It comes back and right now I don't know if i can keep it out.... I hate the way death calls.... the way pain screams.... the void becons... And they want me.... And i hate it.... why can't I be free of it? So much time.... so many scars.... so many attempts.... what's the point?	1
I’m just so devastated.Im about to spend two years of my birthday and the holidays alone. Again. I spent the holidays and my birthday in Basic Training, and its about to happen again. I stay in the barracks because I have no one to hang out with due to them being on leave. I can choose to go home, but it's too expensive and I do not have the funds to do so, all of my family is back at home. I do not have any friends to hang out with and finding friends off post is even harder for me.	1
She texted me a few hours later and said: "I hope you're able to move past your issues so our friendship can move forward". I haven't responded, and don't plan to. I cry myself to sleep at night enough as it is without also worrying about maintaining a fake personality for her. I probably won't be opening up to anyone like that again anytime soon (except, of course, to all of you wonderful people on the internet). Deep down, I know that most of the people in my life wouldn't react the way she did. But I just don't think I can build up the motivation to try it, not when I struggle just to get up in the morning.	1
Me: "Fuck you. I'll have this broken arm FOREVER!"	1
Welp, the other friends canceled and it was just us 3. We had some dinner and then her boyfriend suggested we go see a movie. I was already dressed and ready so why the hell not. I'm pretty sure she agreed(it's honestly hard to tell sometimes with her.) We got there and the movie me and her boyfriend were wanting to see was already playing. And she was being indecisive but eventually agreed to go. So me and him are hurrying to get to our seats while she just takes her time shuffling along. We already missed the first 15minutes. We had just had dinner but she wanted to stop at the concession and she just didn't seem interested at all about being there.	0
I'm the person everyone refers to when they say "There's always someone worse." Extremely stupid; embarassing myself on a daily basis with my poor IQ and lack of understanding anything.	1
I wonder when this will end.It doesn’t go away with love. Depression continues to exist even when you think you have found the love of your life. I look at my partner and see the sun. I am looking through foggy lenses, though. Some days I feel so lonely I can’t stand it, even while holding the hand of the best person I have ever known.	1
I feel so unwanted to the point I've started deleting all my social media to isolate myself even more. It's beginning to eat away at me and my depression is coming back, as much as I hate to admit it.	1
And I feel bad about feeling this way? I feel bad that I’m the one who can’t seem to smile and laugh when everyone else around me can do it just fine.	1
Thank you to who ever takes the time to read this... GF stopped taking antidepressants So my LDR girlfriend just recently stopped taking antidepressants because her mother pressured her into it. She clearly needs them, she can barely function without them and I told her but she refuses to take them again. Her mother, by the way, is bipolar and very mentally abusive. It seems like my GF had been convinced by her mother that not taking meds is the way to go. I told my parents about this and they agree with her not taking them, claiming it’ll help the “chemicals leave her body.” I don’t know what to do. I want to support her decision but her getting off her meds is clearly affecting her negatively and she’s even sadder and less motivated to do anything now. It’s currently impossible for us to live together and we visit each other 1-2 times a year when school is out. We’re both in uni.	1
I wonder when this will end.Post-Graduation Depression I recently graduated from college, and over the past couple of months I’ve grown increasingly depressed. I feel this profound sense of loss and it feels as if the color has drained from the world. What’s shocking to me is that I honestly hated college - I was either working or studying 24x7. I rarely had a single moment for myself or friends and was constantly exhausted and anxious. Now, I have a great job, live with my girlfriend, have almost no debt (thanks to working so much in college), and live in my ideal area. My life is comparatively so much better, but I feel this knot in my stomach as if I just finished a good book or beat the story of a video game and now I’m finally seeing how much of myself I’ve given up to get to where I am. Life feels devoid of adventure and I feel like I have no passion left. I’ve struggled with depression for a long time, but it’s weird to have it catch up with me at the point in my life where past sacrifices were meant to mitigate it. I feel like nothing matters, so why try? Hey guys, I've decided to turn to reddit to try to get some help with my lack of motivation.	1
At night I’m usually in bed by 10, not because I’m out of things to do, but because I’m either drunk or bored.	1
Everyone who’s happy acts like life is just some natural occurrence. Like things just happened to them and fell into place. This couldn’t be further from the truth of my experience. Nothing ever just happens organically. Either I try hard and fail due to my lack of intelligence, or I don’t do anything at all. It’s hard to stay happy after constant failure and social rejection. I’ve never had interests or goals or relationships or friends. I never will. These thing don’t just happen. You have to be a certain kind of person for them to happen. I am not that person. I will never be that person because I don’t even know who I want to be, and if I figured that out I would be too insecure to become that.	1
Just things like that. Lots more too, but I'm just going to post this now while I still have the nerve to do it. Finding it difficult after college Hi. Im 23 and lately I've lost interest in everything. It kinda started last semester, I finished my masters and missed out on a 1.1 from a bad assignment, can't find any jobs relating to my degree and am currently stuck in a miserable retail job. Since the new year started everything has been getting tougher. I've been applying for PhDs, science jobs and anything that i could use my degree for, and everything Ive applied for I've been rejected from. My supervisor I was applying for scholarships with has kinda just abandoned me because I was declined from a competitive scholarship he wanted his project funded for. I feel like everything relates back that I narrowly missed out on my top grade so I'm basically an idiot. Since then I'm in a retail job where I get shouted at by customers every day. My roommate and best friend landed me saying she was leaving our apartment and ringing the landlord-literally out of nowhere-, so I've to leave the city and move back home. I've been prescribed antidepressants before but I found that they made me feel worse and I couldn't stay on them. I feel like I'm just stuck in a rut and I'll never get out. All my friends are either in phds or jobs that they like and I'm the only one in a miserable job. I've applied for another masters, the one I initially wanted before I got accepted into the one I degreed in, but I feel like it's just a waste of time.	1
Night seems endless because I can't see much of anything no matter where I try to look. From minor fears to worst nightmares stalk me like I'm nothing but an insignificant prey who's time has come. I'm exhausted and need sleep, but only nightmares haunt me or the fear of being attacked while I'm immobile by unconsciousness...	1

I tried something last night that I’m ashamed of now...I thought it’d make things better and as I tried I was overcome with regret. Please don’t ever do something you’ll regret. Or anything stupid for that matter. Life your life as if it was your last. Your life was given to you for a reason, don’t end it yourself. It’s a gift..things will get better..just gotta be patient.	1
I had just shaved and I realize I’m not the best looking guy in the world, but I didn’t know that’s how strangers perceived me. I kept a calm demeanor until I got back to my car and I just complete broke down and I was bawling all the way home.  I don’t know why it hurt so much, but I felt like complete shit.	1

My friend (let's call him T, for now) and I had a dispute over what we classify as exposing each other. T was very drunk and gave some information I kept very personal out to my other friends and myself who were sober at the time. He mentioned the last time I got high, but he did mention how long ago. This is important because Ive had an on and off history of depression which I've been struggling with years, and I previously I used to combat it by developing a drug habit. I've been working hard to be clean for 3 years, and I've kept all this under the rug because I didn't wish to be labelled by my friends as irresponsible, or be denied respect as their friend. I buried my past and drug habits for good,  doing so brought me great happiness because this was the first thing I felt I like I myself was worth something and it let me come out of depression for a long time. He did all this because I had made a joke in this particular conversation, to which he reacted negatively, and said I ruined his reputation though my joke was not intentional to do so. Because of this, people I trust  now are asking me if I do drugs or partake in self harm because of what he said about me. Some people I'm friends with are asking me if I need counselling though I'm clean. I'm not sure if I can forgive him and it's made me feel less than a person, which is something I haven't felt in 3 years. I feel worthless again and I'm not quite sure I can mend all my friendships that probably think down upon lowest point in life. Should I cut ties with T? What should I do if now my other friends  might not see me the same way anymore?Would you still be friends? Are we unreasonable? Hello dear people of Reddit	0
SCENARIO TWO I have this friend who always makes weird implication towards how stingy I am.  They made assumptions about my contributions to me and my SO and said things like, "Oh, if given the opportunity, would you kill [so's name] and claim his insurance policy", "You know greedy people normally turn out to be the poorest bunch in the population right?".  The fact is, I have been contributing to the relationship between my SO, my SO is older than me, so in a way, my SO is more financially independent.  At times when SO is helping me out, I always mark the number down so I know how much I owe SO [actually he calculated the amount and sends me invoices].  But I won't disclose such details to my friends.  I am just disappointed as to how people assume things and the last thing I want is to be the victim in every f*ing relationship.	0
In the meantime, I'm existing, trying to experience new things and connect to people as much as I am able to, but I can't shake the conviction that I'll eventually resolve to leave by my own hand, despite whatever life I've made for myself.	1
It would just be so much easier to die, why do people bother with life? What is the point? Everyone has always said that things "get better" but they don't really. They change and then something else sucks.	1
Any advice is welcomed.My parents only having expectations for me to succeed just makes me feel like the biggest failure of my brothers. Which not only is bullshit but also makes me just not try in the first place a lot of the time. Because if I try and fail its worse because I’m expected to succeed. I don’t even understand why they expect me to be the successful one. I barely got acceptable grades in high school until senior year when I just took easy courses. I failed English and nearly failed Spanish in 9th grade because I was too lazy to put in any effort. I barely ever brought home friends or did extracurricular activities most of high school. But for some reason I’m their grand vision for who’s gonna make the family proud. I just cried for an hour straight. and god damn does it feel good to have some sort of emotion in me after 3 months of feeling empty.Ending my life if I turn 18 Things around me had become less interesting. I've become so bored to the point I just don't wanna live anymore. I want to change but I realized I am just being a hypocrite so I'm ending it. I did not learn to love myself nor anyone. I asked advices from acquaintances but their advices are all the same and day by day I've become more depressed and I did not tell anyone about it anymore because what's the point?	1
Sorry this is all over the place, I'm just really deep into it right now and needed to vent. I dont understand how people can be so interested in so many things First, let me apologize for formatting issues, I am typing this on mobile.	1
What are things you’ve done that have worked? If this gets worse there's only 1 answer Hey guys, I've been doing mostly ok for the past few months after trying to kill myself. Some days I really have to drag myself through though. I can't fall back into that cycle, I know exactly where it leads. Advice for making it through school In my second year of college my mental health went down drastically and I lost all of my motivation and basically most of my ability to function. I couldn’t do any schoolwork without panicking and crying because I didn’t think I could do it. I was scared of everything. During finals, my cat died and I just sorta gave up. I failed everything and took a year off. My family was so disappointed and treated me so differently for the year that I was out. About a month and a half before the fall semester of 2017, I got on a new medication and decided to felt good enough to go back to school. I knew I had no other option anyway. I did surprisingly well that semester but now that break is over, I’m finding myself just as terrified as I was that semester I failed. I don’t know what happened and I don’t know how to get back to functioning again. I can’t drop out again. Why do I feel so low after having such a strong start? I really thought things were getting better but I feel like I’m being taken over by this again. If anyone else has any advice for getting through it and regaining faith in myself I’d love to hear it. Dear depression, please please let me be. I know I can do so much good and actually get somewhere in life but you are constantly holding me down, suffocating me. Once I think I've escaped your grip you show me you never let go and I'm reminded of how tightly we are woven together. I can't breathe. I can't eat. I can't sleep. all I want is some peace. you creep into my bedroom at night when you know I'm alone. you destroy everything inside me until I'm just a hollow shell of a small sad girl. why?! why can't you let me be? let me succeed? you bring fear, doubt, guilt, all the bad thoughts. I run and fight for the little bit of light I see through my window in the morning. but every night you are back. sometimes you don't even leave and it can be days, weeks, months til I get another chance at seeing the light. This is not living, this is not a life i wish my son's to see in me. You have taken me from myself. it isn't fair. I just want to be free of your poison. I need an escape from the never-ending torment that you bring. please please, just let me be. :"( It’s my birthday and I’m done being miserable! I’ve been very depressed for about 3 years now. I stayed to myself. Didn’t work, didn’t hang out with friends. Today is my 26th birthday. For the past few weeks, I’ve hammered the idea into my head that my 26th year will be the year that I pull myself out of my hole and get my shit together.	1
I have a family that loves me and a boyfriend and a few good friends I know care but I just find myself thinking that theyd be happier if I wasn't around. Everything I've tried to do has just been a failure and I've just lost interest in life. Some days I really don't want to leave my bed and just lie there because I'm just going to fail again.	1
With my career, I’m interested in how technology affects people and society; like internet addiction, social media, artificial intelligence, etc. That is kind of what drew me to my major in the first place, which is User Experience Design. However, I do little of that (the research side of things, which includes talking to people and learning their stories, then coming up with conclusions based on that data on how you can improve a digital service) and more the design/development side of things (like visual/graphic/UI design and web development, just building the fucking thing), which I’m good with, but it both stresses me out and bores the shit out of me. I think it’d be fulfilling to be a UX Researcher for a popular social app just because I would be able to study how people interact with it. Or do that for a consultancy/agency or something, and start a blog/podcast about technology+society. I kind of largely detest the Silicon Valley tech utopianism that’s sweeping the country, it seems to be making everyone I know (and myself) unhappy in really subtle ways, but it’s become almost a cult of sorts. I could turn what I learn about user research to that.	1
I used to be Christian, and used to pray. Now that I'm not, I'm realizing how truly alone I am in dealing with all this. My friends all live in the city center. They have jobs and livelihoods. Ultimately, I have to physically do things by myself. No one's gonna save me. It's heartbreaking. Physically, I'm just so alone.Sometimes when it gets too much, I go to my room, grab my pillow and scream as loud as I can. I just did it, it feels better.	1
Afterwards I started living with my now SO, still during our teens in a studio. The idea was triggered and pushed for by me as a solution after a bout of infidelity on his side after he moved to study in a city a couple hours away. He partook in intimate relations with a girl he knew from another country over webcam due to ‘’loneliness’’ and held the act in the same regards as watching porn whereas I didn’t. We tried to work things out.	1
Note: It's not a problem with my thyroid or adrenal gland I already had those checked twice by two different doctors. Back pain has brought me to a dark space. I’ve been struggling with back pain for 2 years now and I’m 17.	1
Sorry for the rant, just wondering if anyone is expierencing this or idk. I've never talked about this to anyone I've struggled with depression since I was in 2nd grade. For the last 7 years it's gotten worst, I'm 20 at the moment. When I was 13 I was raped occasionally. Being raped when it first happen didn't bother me as much because I didnt understand what was happening until years later. What did bother me at the time was that I felt alone. I've always felt alone, never felt like anyone cared for me or about me. I fought with my mom and step dad a lot which made me feel even more lonely. I never talked about feeling lonely to anyone because I was always embarrassed about it and still do. Because me and my parents had a rocky relationship I would be abused by both at times. One time I was arguing with my mom and she ended up getting a 2 by 4 and started hitting me with it. I never rasied my hands at my parents, just talked a lot of shit and was an asshole to them. My parents kicked me out of their house when I was 14. I ended up living with my grandpa. This made me feel unwanted and even more lonely now that my parents gave up on me. I lived with my grandpa for about 9 months before he sent me back to my parents because he couldn't "afford" to keep me. I wasn't an asshole to my grandpa nor was I mean to him, I just was a teen who stayed up late and took long showers. My grandpa giving up on me was heartbreaking for me. I felt like no one wanted me and if I ended everything then everything would be better. I didn't even last a week at my parents house, they shipped me off to live with some family who lived in the rural country area instead of the city. I lived there for maybe 4 months and finished my freshmen year of high school there. I didn't feel welcomed anywhere I went and for the most part I felt more beyond alone. Majority of the time at my uncle's I was in my room, alone and desperate for a friend. After 4 lonely months of really being alone I was given back to my parents again. After coming home broken I learned to keep to myself. No one wanted me and no one cared.	1
I'm sick of baggage from my childhood and teen years weighing me down and all this is just adding to it.Thinking of quiting my job I work as a waitress and it's killing me inside. I have anxiety along with depression and having to answer phones, greet customers, small talk etc is just exhausting for me. I also don't get along with some people there. My boss and the chef mainly. I get really anxious the entire day beforehand (work evenings) and it just puts me in a bad spot. Another reason for wanting to quit is I'm currently a student and I'm in the last leg of my final year dissertation, I just don't want the stress of having to go deal with my boss and having to take orders etc when I have this important deadline coming up.	1
Ironically what I discovered was that working on the project itself was a huge mood-booster for me, since it gave me a sense of purpose and was a great outlet for creativity. As I've gotten further along in the work, I've noticed my depression level has slowly started rising again. But for a while, I was actually in the "Normal" range of depressive emotions! I couldn't believe it.	1

Let me introduce myself first. Currently im a 19yo boy who turns 20 in March, I live in Belgium (grammar will be bad sorry). I have 1 older brother,  2 loving parents who are still together. And oh yeahh i have a very cute pupper as well. Financially everything is fine. Basically a family some people only can dream for. I mainly play on nintendo consoles (switch, 3ds, gba, n64) and the MMORPG runescape (dont laugh :)) I consider myself a extravert to my friends but an introvert when im talking to girls (lol) or strangers.	1
I was yelled at by other people and ostracized.	1
Happy birthday man, I miss you and I’m sorry. It feels like so much time has gone by that any attempt at reconciliation would do more harm than anything else at this point. We used to have so much fun, but nostalgia only makes everyone feel worse, and more often than not leads to poor choices. It’s a sweet substance, like sugar, just with a punch in the gut to remind you that you can’t ever go back to something you once valued so highly.	1
I wish I was born attractive... fuck"You have to give your life meaning," they say. How exactly am I supposed to give my life meaning when life's basic structure is forcing me to live in such a stressful manner? We're all going in the same direction to an eternity of work and labor. I want to give my life meaning, but I'm too busy trying to survive in this stupid system. People try their hardest so they can barely get by, and for what?	1
Moving forward, how can I feel better about the whole situation? I feel sick to my stomach and absolutely awful.

Just wondering how people cope with this?  Feeling ashamed of my depression...does anyone else feel like this? I’ve been going through a really bad depressive episode and today at school someone said “ remember when you were all ‘sunshiney’ and happy and laughed all the time? You should go back to when you acted like that.”	1
I'm going to post this and go to sleep, but I promise you all that I will respond to each and every person who comments when I wake up. I love you guys! Feel free to start without me :pTaking Tylenol PM, etc. in the middle of the day to sleep I work in an industry that I can be unemployed for months at a time. I have not had a job since Thanksgiving. I have decided to do something about it and move to a city where there’s more work in my field. In the meantime, however I find myself sitting in a dark room alone bored and ill often take sleeping pills like unisom, or Tylenol pm, and sometimes even Xanax and go to sleep in the middle of the afternoon. Like right now I’m struggling with the thought of taking one right now. I have anxiety and I don’t have much money to spend so I figure if I sleep a lot I won’t spend money. Am I completely messed up? Or does anyone else do this?My boring sob story Family members told me all the time that being an adult is shit and I should make the most of being a kid. So when depression hit me I thought it was normal, but it didn’t feel “right.” I wasn’t upset all the time, it was just like a flat misery sort of feeling.	1
All this shit because we can't fucking return home, and we're here because is ny fucking fault.	1
I'm also so overwhelmed by guilt by how selfish my internal response has been. He has cheated on me before multiple times, and I can't help but ruminate on how if I were prettier this wouldn't have happened and how it effects me. One recent (smaller) time just happened and I've had to take care of his emotions while being angry about this main terrible incident and that one. Furthermore, I'm selfishly worried about how badly this is affecting me. One of the few (maybe only?) things going right in my life is school and this is affecting me so negatively in my inability to concentrate or motivate myself. I'm also upset by how critical others have been of me in this even though they are at least partially justified. He posted his story to Reddit and got mostly cautious support. I posted mine and got a lot of messages calling me a pervert, an enabler, a shitposter, and a terrible person. He told his parents and one of the things they said was "all three of you made mistakes". Unrelated, but last night he posted a photo of us in the ER and a girl who hates me replied "ew you're back with her? Nonono what are you doing." I have no idea what I've done to make everyone in my life hate me this much. I don't have anyone left and I'm scared to lose the one person that has stuck around so far.The good times don't make the bad times worth living. People always act like it's worth living through bad times so you can experience the good times but to me it doesn't feel worth it. Even the good times are tainted and I can barely ever even "enjoy" them the way I'm supposed to. They barely even make it into the picture when I think about my life.why is it so hard to make money but easy for others? reading success stories on reddit, it sounds like everyone is a millionaire. The world needs more "lollipop moments". Back in middle school, I was helping out at a sunday school, tutoring primary kids. There was this adorable little girl who was struggling to sing the right tunes of a hymn. Even though I have absolutely no musical background, I tried to help her get her vocals and lyrics right by singing the hymn together. Eventually, I told her to continue repeating it herself and that every practice is an improvement from the last.	1
Yesterday some things happened that really made me feel like things were ending. First, we had talked about planning a trip President's day weekend, but she had a surgery and she didn't want to plan anything until it was done (that's a whole other thing that's bothering me). When I asked her yesterday, she said she thought President's day was in March and she promised to see her brother this weekend, so "we'll see". She also told me she likes working late and going to the gym at like 930. Apparently she's been working 12 hour days for the past week. The gym part hurt because one of my favorite things to do with her was work out, and now I've lost my gym buddy.	1
Anyway, we’re dipshit high schoolers, so we joke about depression and suicide in our friend group. The group knows Golf has depression, they have no clue about mine though. Anyway, when I started hanging out with him I did what I’ve been doing for a year and a half. Joking about my depression and making jokes about offing myself. I didn’t know Golf had it until a couple months ago, but soon after we started hanging out he started joking about it too. Well he got reported to the counseling center, a couple of times in fact. But they’re honestly useless, so it didn’t help. It came to a head last night when the group basically kidnapped him and forced him to go to a hospital. They didn’t tell me for whatever reason. I still haven’t figured out why. But eventually I got there. The night is a blur from there, I didn’t eat anything since breakfast, and that was noodles. As I’m just now typing this I realize that I’m at around 30 hours without food now. But that’s not important. I did my best to be there for Golf. He went home safe with his parents and is going to go to therapy/counseling. It was an awful day yesterday, a couple of events made Golf’s depression way worse for him. I’m glad we got him to the hospital before he hurt himself.	1
And i dont have enough willpower to handle her anymore, i was called "shit", "useless", "egoist"  yesterday, i just can only stare on her and be treated like she wants because i cant do anything.Total helplessness and i only have girlfriend who is helpful but she doesnt have her own place and she is in another country now	1
Last Monday I snapped. It hit me. Everything I lost came crashing in on me. I got in my car, picked a place I knew well to ram my car into at 120mph. I was screaming at myself to do it. My left hand steering towards the end, my right hand steering me to survive. An image of my dog in my mind kept me on the road. I knew she'd miss me too much.	1

We began dating after meeting on a popular dating app and we hit it off fast. Similar interest, goals, outlooks, expectations, and lifestyle. We became extremely close with in two months and then out of the blue she tells me its over. I didn't feel it was a justifiable way to end the relationship. I contacted her and we had long winded email correspondence with in which she had this quote to me " I feel lost at work, lost in my personal life, and just lost with trying to find my happiness. You do make me happier. And idk what just snapped last week but I was super depressed all week ."	1
